#
# Two things this script does that the obvious version does not:
#
#   * Parallel workers, each with its own soffice profile. Two headless instances sharing
#     ~/.config/libreoffice block on the profile lock and one of them converts nothing at
#     all — silently, with exit status 0.
#   * Per-format identity (`report__docx`, not `report`). Two documents differing only by
#     extension both convert to report.pdf and one overwrites the other, which reads as a
#     mysterious parity failure on whichever lost.
#
# The checks are the same three, in the same order, as corpus-parity.sh: page count, then
# extractable words, then font embedding. Each is cheap and rules out a whole class, and
# a wrong page count makes everything after it meaningless.
#
# NOT COMPARABLE TO ANY SCOREBOARD RECORDED BEFORE 2026-08-13. Check 2 used to count
# `pdftotext … | wc -w`; it now counts only tokens carrying at least one Unicode letter or
# digit. See `words_of` below for why, and `dotnet/probes/gate-01/results.md` for the
# conversion — the raw count is still emitted, as the last TSV column, so a run under this
# script reproduces the old verdict exactly and the two can be reconciled document by
# document. A figure quoted without saying which metric produced it is now ambiguous.

# Extractable words, for check 2. A token counts as a word iff it carries at least one
# Unicode letter or digit — categories L* or N*, which is what Python's str.isalnum() is.
# Emits "<words> <rawwords>", the second being the old `pdftotext | wc -w` figure, kept so
# every run can still reproduce the verdict it would have given before this changed.
#
# WHY, because this is the check that decides "is the same text present" and the answer turns
# on what counts as text. Both renderers write list labels and rendering markers into the PDF
# text layer as real text-showing operators with real ToUnicode mappings, and `wc -w` scored
# every one of them as a word:
#
#   * an authored probe holding its body text fixed at 64 words and varying only the list
#     label reads 64 with no list and 76 with twelve U+2022 bullets, twelve U+F0A7
#     Symbol/Wingdings bullets, or twelve U+2013 dashes — a 19% swing on a document whose
#     text did not change by one character;
#   * `ODs-February-2022-Airbus-Commercial-Aircraft.xlsx` — the reference emits `###` **1101
#     times**, the column-too-narrow marker. Those 1101 "words" were cancelling a real
#     895-word surplus in our own output, so the document passed check 2 by luck;
#   * `fy2011-aip-grants.xls` — 11538 standalone `$` and `-` against the reference's 9020,
#     the accounting number format for a zero cell. Raw counts differ by 2518 and fail;
#     letter-or-digit counts are **43201 and 43201**, exact.
#
# A column-overflow marker is not text and neither is a bullet the renderer chose. The gate
# was manufacturing failures out of them — the same shape as the pdf-ops.py stroke pairing
# that once produced 142 phantom `box` notes and cost a dispatched round.
#
# Three things this deliberately does NOT do.
#   * It does not widen the 2% band. That band separates hyphenation drift from missing text;
#     widening it to absorb a systematic term hides the term instead of removing it.
#   * It does not strip an enumerated set of code points, which is the obvious fix and is
#     wrong twice over: the set would be fitted to the documents in hand, and it does not even
#     work — measured on the slides track, the reference writes its Wingdings bullets at
#     U+F06E/U+F06C/U+F0D8/U+F0A7 and Paperless writes the same glyphs at
#     U+E439/U+E5CD/U+E46F/U+E437. A list built from one side strips nothing on the other.
#   * It does not drop short tokens. A numbering label (`1.`, `iv.`, `a)`) carries a digit or
#     a letter and stays a word on both sides; the probe above reads 76 for a numbered list
#     under both metrics. That is the definition working, not a hole in it.
#
# python3 rather than grep or awk, and this is not a style preference. This image carries only
# the `C` and `C.utf8` locales. Measured on a file of one token per script: `grep -c
# '[[:alnum:]]'` under C.utf8 counts Cyrillic and Greek but **not Han**, and mawk — the default
# awk here — counts neither, scoring ASCII only. Either would silently drop every wholly-CJK
# or wholly-Cyrillic token while looking perfectly correct on the English majority of the
# corpus, which is the `fc-match` trap in a second dimension. str.isalnum() is Unicode by
# construction and cannot be changed by the environment. The split is `str.split()`, which
# reproduces `wc -w` on 1068 of 1068 corpus PDFs — so the tokenisation is untouched and the
# only thing that changed is the filter.
# This function is also the seam for the in-process extractor (`paperless analyze`): it returns
# exactly the pair that verb should emit, so replacing poppler here is a substitution of this
# body and nothing else in the script. The definition above is the durable part and must not be
# re-decided by the reimplementation — and the `wc -w` reproduction is a *control on poppler's
# tokenisation*, so a different reader has to re-establish it against the `rawwords` column of a
# stored sweep before any verdict it produces is comparable to one here.

# One inode, one render. This mount is case-insensitive and carries alias directory entries:
# `Foo.ppt` and `Foo.PPT` are the same file under two names, and how many of them a glob
# enumerates is not stable between runs. Two consequences, and the second is the dangerous one:
#
#   * the TOTAL line over-counts, which is merely misleading; and
#   * the per-format identity lower-cases the extension, so BOTH spellings map to the same id
#     and therefore the same output path. Two workers then render one document to one file
#     while a third step reads it. Slides round 63 caught this as a single document worth
#     94.14 of a 989 abs_ink total, appearing and disappearing between sweeps of an unchanged
#     tree.
#
# `find -printf '%D:%i\t%p'` keys on device and inode with no shell round trip, so it is safe
# for the filenames with spaces, brackets and per-cent signs this corpus contains. It cannot
# drop a genuine document: two genuine documents are never one inode.
#
# WHICH spelling survives matters, and no ordering rule gets it right. Some aliases
# are an upper-cased extension (`Foo.PPT` beside `Foo.ppt`) and some are a wholly
# lower-cased name (`template pilot logbook.xls` beside `Template Pilot Logbook.xls`),
# so "prefer lower case" and "prefer upper case" are each correct for one family and
# wrong for the other. Keeping the wrong one makes every manifest-keyed scorer report
# the document as unswept.
#
# git is the authority: it tracks exactly one spelling per inode, the real one. So the
# dedup prefers a tracked path and falls back to first-seen when the corpus is not a
