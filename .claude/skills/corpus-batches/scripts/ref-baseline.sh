#
# WHY THIS EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `batch-check.sh`
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `batch-check.sh` measures ours against the reference in one pass and refuses to start
# without a built CLI. That coupling is right for a round and wrong for two situations:
#
#   * The build is unavailable (no package feed, a broken restore) but soffice works. The
#     expensive half of the gate — 534 soffice conversions — can still be banked.
#   * The reference binary itself changed. Then every stored figure is against a superseded
#     binary and the reference column has to be re-measured *before* any verdict means
#     anything. That is the case this was written for: this container has 26.2.4.2 where
#     every figure in TODO.batches.md was taken against 24.2.7.2.
#
# The conventions are `batch-check.sh`'s, deliberately identical so the two are comparable
# column for column:
#
#   * one soffice profile per worker — two headless instances sharing ~/.config/libreoffice
#     block on the profile lock and one converts nothing, silently, with exit status 0;
#   * per-format identity (`report__docx`, not `report`) — two documents differing only by
#     extension both convert to report.pdf and one overwrites the other;
#   * an absolute outdir, because soffice takes its profile as `file://$OUT/profN` and a
#     relative path there is not a URL, so it starts with an unusable profile and converts
#     nothing while reporting success.
#
# The version is recorded in the output. A baseline whose header does not name the binary it
# was taken against is the thing that caused this whole re-baseline, so it is not optional.
