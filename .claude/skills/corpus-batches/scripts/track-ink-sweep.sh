# `batch-check.sh` answers "is the right text on the right page". Once a track passes that
# — slides is at 152/163 with every remaining failure attributed — the only instrument left
# is where the ink lands, and running `pdf-image-diff.py` by hand over 163 documents is how
# a round gets spent. This does both from one pair of renderings.
#
# Writes:
#   rows.tsv    the same seven columns batch-check.sh writes
#   parity.tsv  those, sorted, with a header
#   ink.tsv     path, pages, |ink|% (unsigned), ink% (signed), major pages, verdict
#               Two ink columns, deliberately, and both are named in the file's own
#               header row.  For eleven rounds this script wrote ONE column, summed the
#               *signed* figure into it, and labelled the total `INK` -- while
#               `probes/slides-r39/ink-ranking.py`, the other half of the same skill,
#               headlined the *unsigned* one.  Two different measurements circulating
#               under one name is the trap this project has paid for repeatedly, and
#               here it lived inside a single skill.  Rank on unsigned; decide on
#               signed.  A signed sum lets a deficit cancel a surplus, so filling the
#               deficit reads as a regression.
#   cmp/<id>.txt  the full per-page pdf-image-diff report for every document
#
# Three things it does that the obvious version does not:
#
#   * Sums the per-page ink column itself, and therefore does NOT pass --quiet.
#     pdf-image-diff.py totals the major-page count and nothing else, and a page that is
#     not major still carries ink — dropping those understates a document by most of its
#     figure on a deck whose error is spread thin.
#   * Takes the CLI as an argument, so a sweep can run against a snapshot while the tree
#     is rebuilt underneath it. Checksum the snapshot against the tree before starting;
#     a stale copy passes every other check this skill prescribes.
#   * Reuses reference PDFs from an earlier run when given a refdir. The reference cannot
#     change while nothing touches soffice, and it is half the wall clock. Compare the two
#     runs' reference columns row for row afterwards, which is the check that says so.

# One inode, one render. This mount is case-insensitive and carries alias directory entries:
# `Foo.ppt` and `Foo.PPT` are the same file under two names, and how many of them a glob
# enumerates is not stable between runs. Two consequences, and the second is the dangerous one:
#
#   * the TOTAL line over-counts, which is merely misleading; and
#   * the per-format identity lower-cases the extension, so BOTH spellings map to the same id
#     and therefore the same output path. Two workers then render one document to one file
#     while a third step reads it. Slides round 63 caught this as a single document worth

# `find -printf '%D:%i\t%p'` keys on device and inode with no shell round trip, so it is safe
# for the filenames with spaces, brackets and per-cent signs this corpus contains. It cannot
# drop a genuine document: two genuine documents are never one inode.
#
# WHICH spelling survives matters, and no ordering rule gets it right. Some aliases
# are an upper-cased extension (`Foo.PPT` beside `Foo.ppt`) and some are a wholly
# lower-cased name (`template pilot logbook.xls` beside `Template Pilot Logbook.xls`),
# so "prefer lower case" and "prefer upper case" are each correct for one family and
# wrong for the other. Keeping the wrong one makes every manifest-keyed scorer report
# the document as unswept.
#
# git is the authority: it tracks exactly one spelling per inode, the real one. So the
# dedup prefers a tracked path and falls back to first-seen when the corpus is not a
