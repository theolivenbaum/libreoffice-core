    # fonts-dejavu-core, DejaVu sits ahead of WenQuanYi Zen Hei in the fallback chain, and
    # 267 of the 534 corpus reference PDFs resolve a fallback. Holding LibreOffice constant

    # rather than the exit status.

    # measured. If that test is ever retired, revisit this check rather than deleting it.
