"""Census, out of 26.2.4.2's OWN renderings, of what the horizontal-band rule paints.

    census-pdf.py <sweep.tsv> <out-prefix>

Two questions, both read from the PDF's path operators:

  MIXED  -- a row boundary at which the reference draws bands of MORE THAN ONE width side by
            side.  Because the reference top-aligns every horizontal table band (measured,
            results.md §3.1), such a boundary is one shared band TOP with two thicknesses on it.
            A model that centres one band per boundary cannot draw it.  This is O85's paint.
            The base rate is the boundary that has two or more side-by-side segments of the SAME
            width, which the centred model draws correctly.

  CUT    -- a table crossing a page boundary: the verticals of page p end where a horizontal rule
            sits, the verticals of page p+1 begin where a horizontal rule sits at the very top of
            the body, and at least two of their x positions agree.  A PROXY, and an upper bound:
            a table ending exactly at the foot of one page beside a different table opening the
            next would also match.
