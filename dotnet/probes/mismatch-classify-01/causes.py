"""Adds this round's cause classification to the two-reference screen.

Reads `screen26.tsv` (the ours / 24.2 / 26.2 comparison) and emits the round's
deliverable TSV: every one of the 87 gate mismatches with a cause and a one-line
observation.  A document is only given a cause the round actually established;
where it was screened but not read, the cause says so rather than guessing.
