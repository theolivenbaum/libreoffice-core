# tabright-r166 — a right tab stop past the paragraph's right indent

**Reference: `/opt/libreoffice26.2/program/soffice`, LibreOffice 26.2.4.2
(`0229ac93fcf0d7cbc6376066c6f35021cef002dc`).** Ours is this tree's own CLI.

## Headline: the candidate fix is REFUTED, and nothing was landed

`probes/pages-r164` §2 diagnosed `02_mcar`'s 313-against-312 as a right tab's trailing stretch
being fitted against the paragraph's right indent where the reference fits it against the frame's
edge, named `TabRuler.WidthOf`:196 as the seat, and characterised the rule as

> `titleEnd ≤ tabStop − rightIndent − ε` **and** `titleEnd + numberWidth ≤ tabStop`, with ε ≈ 2.5 pt

**That characterisation does not survive a clean sweep, and the patch built from it makes this
fixture worse.** Implemented exactly as the named mechanism says — see §2 — the disagreement with
26.2.4.2 goes from **6 arm-steps to 9**. It was reverted, and the tree's rendering of this fixture
is byte-identical to its rendering before the change.

## 1. The fixture and the sweep

`build.py` writes 110 paragraphs of the shape every `TOC2` entry in `02_mcar` has: a text column
9360 twips wide, a **left** stop at 990 and a **right, dot-leader** stop declared at 9360 — exactly
the column's right edge — and `w:ind w:left="720" w:right=R w:hanging="720"`. Ten right indents ×
eleven title lengths. `word/settings.xml` is written, empty, so the importer takes the OOXML
compatibility defaults (`paperless-corpus/SKILL.md`).

`score.py` prints `#` where the page number stays on the entry's first line and `.` where it does
not, read from `pdftotext`'s own line grouping. **Two instrument corrections were needed and both
changed the answer:**

- A first cut keyed the number's baseline against a *global* set of baselines, so arms on the same
  line of different paragraphs paired with each other. It reported the reference fitting the number
  only at the **widest** indents, which is backwards.
- Matching the literal `2-123` reads an entry that *did* fit as one that did not, because where the
  number overprints the leader the extractor loses the hyphen — `....2123`. The pattern is `2-?123`.
  This one moved three cells of the reference's own table, including the `r0n54` cell the analysis
  below turns on.

`sweep.txt` holds both tables. The boundary — the largest title that keeps the number on the line:

| right indent (tw) | 0 | 180 | 360 | 540 | 720 | 850 | 994 | ≥1130 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 26.2.4.2 | 54 | 54 | 52 | 52 | 52 | 48 | 48 | never |
| this tree | 54 | 52 | 50 | 50 | 48 | 48 | 46 | never |

They agree at a zero right indent and part company as it grows — which is the direction §2's
diagnosis predicts. **Six arm-steps**, two characters each.

## 2. The mechanism is real, and it is not `TabRuler.WidthOf`'s return value

`[src]` `SwTextFormatInfo::GetLineWidth` (`sw/source/core/text/inftxt.cxx`:2132-2182) is the
named seat:

```cpp
SwTwips nLineWidth = Width() - X();
if (!bTabOverMargin && !bTabOverSpacing) return nLineWidth;
SwTabPortion* pLastTab = GetLastTab();
if (!pLastTab) return nLineWidth;
if (pLastTab->GetTabPos() <= Width()) return nLineWidth;
// "text is allowed to use the full text frame area to the right (RR above, but not LL)"
nLineWidth = nTextFrameWidth - X();
```

So where the last tab's stop lies beyond the paragraph's own right boundary, the text after it is
fitted against the **text frame's** edge — and for a right, centred or decimal stop under
`TabOverSpacing` (what every writerfilter document carries) the comment says outright that it
"can back-fill all the available space". The two boundaries differ by exactly the paragraph's end
indent, which is §2's reading.

**Implemented faithfully** — `TabbedSegment` carrying the stop it was placed by, and `WidthOf`
reporting `GapLeft + Width − EndIndent` when that stop is past the line's own edge — the sweep
comes back **indent-independent**: `#` to title 54 in every column from 0 to 994. That is the rule
doing exactly what the source says, and the reference does **not** do it:

| right indent (tw) | 0 | 180 | 360 | 540 | 720 | 850 | 994 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 26.2.4.2 | 54 | 54 | 52 | 52 | 52 | 48 | 48 |
| the patch | 54 | 54 | 54 | 54 | 54 | 54 | 54 |

Nine arm-steps against the six we started with, and wrong in the *other* direction on five of the
seven columns. So something else clamps the reference back, and this round did not find it.

**Three things the next round should not re-derive.**

- **ε is not a constant.** Working the arithmetic from the measured title widths (7.522 pt per
  `A`, number 35.54 pt, line edge 540 − R/20): the excess over the line edge that the reference
  *allows* at its own boundary runs 9.8, 18.8, 12.8, 21.8, 30.8, 7.2, 14.4 pt across the seven
  columns, and the excess it *refuses* at the next arm runs 24.9, 33.9, 27.8, 36.8, 45.8, 22.3,
  29.5. **Those intervals have an empty intersection** — the largest lower bound is 30.8 and the
  smallest upper bound 22.3 — so no single constant excess, ε or otherwise, reproduces the table.
  §2's two-condition form was fitted to a *bold* sweep over a different title range, and it does
  not transfer.
- **`GetTabStop`'s first-stop rule is why the stop is honoured out in the indent at all**, and it
  is already right in this tree. `SwLineInfo::GetTabStop` (`txttab.cxx`:43-62) rejects a stop past
  the paragraph's right boundary — *except the first in the ruler*, for which it instead **raises
  the boundary to the stop's own position**. Measured: at every right indent from 0 to 994 both
  engines put the number's right edge at x 540.0, the declared stop, which is up to 49.7 pt out in
  the indent. `ClampsTabsAtLineEdge` already models this.
- **At right ≥ 1130 both engines move the number to a second line, and where they then put it is a
  separate defect.** The reference right-aligns it at x **608.033** — 68 pt past the text column,
  out in the *page* margin — and we put it at 153.463, at the left. Worth a seat of its own; it is
  not what decides `02_mcar`.

## 3. What is still owed on `02_mcar`

The row is unchanged: 313 pages against 312, and the six ToC page numbers the reference keeps on
their entry's line and we orphan are still orphaned. The *direction* of the defect is confirmed by
this sweep — we break earlier than the reference at every non-zero right indent — and the seat is
still the fit width for a line ending in a deferred stop. What is missing is the clamp that keeps
the reference from taking the whole frame.
