r"""Score the rule model against the CORPUS's own faces and sizes, out of the banked reference.

    corpus-rules.py <ref-dir> > rows.tsv

The authored probe covers six faces at seven sizes; this covers whatever 26.2.4.2 actually drew
over the 947-document corpus, at whatever sizes the documents ask for, with no new render at all
-- `/home/user/gate-r122/ref` holds one reference PDF per corpus document.

**What counts as a text line here, and why the filter is what it is.**  A page's thin horizontal
strokes are underlines, strikethroughs, table borders, paragraph borders and drawing-layer lines,
and only the first two are this model's.  The discriminator is that a text line is drawn across
the *advance of its own run*: it is required to sit in an em-scaled window of a span's baseline
AND to match that span's x-extent at both ends.  A border spans its cell, not its text, and a
drawing line has no span over it at all.  The filter can still admit a border that happens to
underrun a full-width run, so a MISS is a candidate to look at rather than a proven failure --
which is the direction that keeps the number honest, since it can only make the score worse.

Only faces that resolve to a file on this machine are scored.  A document that embeds its own
font is subset into the PDF under a name no system face carries, and its metrics are the file's
rather than the machine's; those are counted and reported separately rather than guessed at.
