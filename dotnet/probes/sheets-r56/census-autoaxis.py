"""How far `ChartLayout.IntervalsThatFit` reaches: every chart with an AUTOMATIC value axis.

`IntervalsThatFit` returns `MaximumAutoIntervalCount` unchanged when the plot states a
`c:majorUnit`, so a stated interval is inert to it. Everything else -- every value axis whose
major unit is automatic -- goes through `available / needed`, and a rule that governs that many
axes across three tracks wants its reach on the table before a line of it is changed.

`ChartLayout` lives in **Paperless.Core**, so this counts all 946 corpus documents and not the
sheets track alone.

Blind spots, stated:
  * A `c:valAx` is counted whether or not its plot is one this code lays out with axes -- a pie
    or a doughnut chart part carries no `c:valAx` at all, so that is mostly self-correcting, but
    a hidden axis (`c:delete val="1"`) is counted here and reaches nothing.
  * `.xls`/`.ppt`/`.doc` binary charts are not counted: their axes come through the Escher chart
    records, not through any XML part.
  * It counts axes, not the axes where the rule actually *bites* -- which is the ones where
    `available / needed` comes out below ten. That number needs the layout run, not the file.
