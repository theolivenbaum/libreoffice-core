# Mutation pin for O83. Three arms, one per error the round removed -- the three are separable and
# each was worth a line or a rule on its own.
#
# `run` greps for compiler errors as well as test results: round 150 lost an arm to a mutation that
# did not compile, which prints NOTHING and reads exactly like an arm that is not pinned.
# Restores with `cp` + `touch`, never `mv` and never `git checkout` alone.
