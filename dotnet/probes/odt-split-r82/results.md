# odt-split-r82 — a floating table is a table, and the `.odt` column 281 → 290

## Environment

| Base commit | `e6be864e4` |
| Reference binary | **`/opt/libreoffice26.2/program/soffice` — LibreOffice 26.2.4.2**, TDF tarball, with the duplicate/Narrow faces in `.duplicates-aside/` and the Latin Noto in `.noto-aside/` |
| Converted corpus | `/home/user/corpus-odf/words/*/odt/*.odt` — 338 documents, 26.2.4.2's own `--convert-to odt` of the words track |
| Original track | `/home/user/sample-files/words` — the same 338 in their original `.docx`/`.doc` spellings |
| Reference halves | `/home/user/gate-odf-r78/ref` (26.2.4.2, all 338 `.odt`) for the ODF column, `/home/user/gate-orig-r81/ref` (24.2.7.2, deliberately — that bank is what the original track's baseline was scored against) for the original track |
| Gate rule | `batch-check.sh`'s of 2026-09-05, reimplemented column for column in `probes/odt-resid-r77/sweep-ours.sh` |
| Workers | 2 throughout |

`/usr/bin/soffice` (24.2.7.2) was used for nothing but the original track's banked reference.

**The banked base was verified rather than assumed.** A fresh render of our half at `e6be864e4`
against `gate-odf-r78/ref` gives **281 match / 27 pages / 11 pages,words / 19 words**, which is the
brief's figure column for column. The sweep's oldest render is 05:58:28 and the binary it measured
was built at 05:56:44, so no rebuild landed inside it.

## What moved

`.odt` column, 338 documents, the same reference bytes on both sides:

| | match | pages | words | pages,words |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| before (`e6be864e4`) | **281** | 27 | 19 | 11 |
| after the cell writing mode alone | 285 | 24 | 19 | 10 |
| after both changes | **290** | 22 | 18 | 8 |

**281 → 290 of 338.** Twenty renderings differ at all; **ten gain a verdict and one loses one**.
The sum of `|page delta|` over the column goes **99 → 73** and the sum of `|glyph delta|`
**56 626 → 28 687**, which is halved.

Gained:

## 1. A cell's writing mode: the namespace is chosen by the *value*

### The rule, at the seat

Writer's own ODF filter maps **both** spellings of the attribute onto one item. Its table-cell item
map holds `style:writing-mode` and `loext:writing-mode` side by side against `RES_FRAMEDIR`
(`sw/source/filter/xml/xmlitemm.cxx`:281-282), and the value handler takes `bt-lr` as
`SvxFrameDirection::Vertical_LR_BT` and `tb-rl90` as `Vertical_RL_TB90` whichever namespace carried
them, leaving every other value to the ordinary `XML_TYPE_TEXT_WRITING_MODE_WITH_DEFAULT` handler
(`sw/source/filter/xml/xmlimpit.cxx`:1008-1030).

The *exporter* is what makes the namespace look like part of the property, and it does it **by
value**:

* `sw/source/filter/xml/xmlexpit.cxx`:193-220 writes `bt-lr` and `tb-rl90` as `loext:writing-mode`
  and lets every other value through to the ordinary path, under a comment that says exactly that.
* The generic property-set path does the same for every other item:
  `SvXMLExportPropertyMapper::_exportXML` calls `CheckExtendedNamespace`
  (`xmloff/source/style/xmlexppr.cxx`:947-952) and, when it answers 1, re-qualifies the attribute
  into `XML_NAMESPACE_LO_EXT` (:1108-1118) — *"We don't seem to have a generic mechanism to write an
  attribute in the extension namespace in case of certain attribute values only, so do this
  manually."*

**This is a sixth instance of the ODF namespace rule this project records, and the first that is a
value rather than a name.** The five already recorded (`drawooo:display`, `loext:shadow-blur`,
`chartext:coordinate-region`, `text:line-break`, `drawooo:sub-view-size`) are properties that live
in an unexpected namespace always. `writing-mode` lives in `style:` for every value ODF 1.3 defines
and in `loext:` for the two it does not — so **grepping the corpus for the attribute name finds it
and tells you nothing**. The converted `.odt` state `style:writing-mode` on 14 264 table cells, of
which 14 261 say `lr-tb`; every one of the 86 `bt-lr` cells is `loext:`. A reader that consults the
specification's spelling therefore finds every horizontal cell and no turned one.

### Measured, one cell per spelling

`gen.py` writes one table whose six cells differ in exactly the spelling and the value of
`writing-mode` on their `style:table-cell-properties`; `probe-reading.txt` is 26.2.4.2's rendering
of it, read as each line's direction vector and box.

| cell | stated | 26.2.4.2 draws |
|---|---|---|
| `c0` | nothing | `dir = (1, 0)`, upright at x 73.55 |
| `c1` | `loext:writing-mode="bt-lr"` | `dir = (0, −1)`, glyphs up, lines stacking rightwards from x 145.96 |
| `c2` | `style:writing-mode="bt-lr"` | **identical**, one 72 pt column along, from x 217.96 |
| `c3` | `style:writing-mode="tb-rl"` | `dir = (0, +1)`, glyphs down, lines stacking **leftwards** |
| `c4` | `loext:writing-mode="tb-rl90"` | identical to `c3` |
| `c5` | `style:writing-mode="tb-lr"` | `dir = (0, +1)`, glyphs down, lines stacking **rightwards** |

So the extension namespace is an **export convention and not an import requirement**: 26.2.4.2 draws
`style:writing-mode="bt-lr"` exactly as it draws the `loext:` spelling. Both are therefore read, and
resolved together — the *level* before the spelling — through
`OdfStyles.ResolveWithoutDefaults(…, candidates, out matched)`, which round 72 added for
`style:font-name` against `fo:font-family`.

`tb-lr` is a **third** direction and the enum has two. It is answered as
`TopToBottomRightToLeft`, which is right about the glyphs and about where the line breaks and wrong
only about which way a second line goes; no `.odt` of the converted corpus states it on a cell.
Upright — what LibreOffice's own DOCX importer does with the corresponding `tbLrV`, *"we can't
handle these"* — would be wrong about all three.

### The layout law was already right, and the probes reproduce it on ODF

`TurnedCellTests` established the law on DOCX in an earlier round. Two of its four facts were
re-measured here on ODF, because the ODF path had never exercised them:

* **A turned cell contributes nothing to its row's height, and a row of only turned cells collapses
  to nothing at all.** `d-alone.fodt` — one row, one `bt-lr` cell holding `Strategy` — comes back
  from 26.2.4.2 with **no text and no borders**: the table is absent from the rendering entirely.
  The C++ shape of it is `lcl_CalcMinCellHeight`'s `SwRectFnSet aRectFnSet(*_pCell)`
  (`sw/source/core/layout/tabfrm.cxx`:5009-5054), which measures a vertical cell across the axis the
  row does not grow on.
* **The line breaks at the cell's height and the stack runs across its width.** `f-rowheight-*.fodt`
  at 0.5, 1 and 2 in: `Strategy` comes back as two lines, then one, then one, and in the two tall
  cases it is drawn from the cell's **bottom** upwards, 142.45 and 214.45 — the text starts at the
  end it runs *from*.

### Reach, and whether the fix touches the sheets and slides readers

Censused over the converted corpus by spelling, value and the element the attribute sits on
(`census_wm` in this round's working notes; the numbers are reproduced in
`OdtLayoutSource.Tables.TextDirection`'s remarks):

| column | on a table cell | elsewhere |
|---|---|---|
| `.odt` (338) | **86 × `loext:…="bt-lr"` in 11 documents**, 3 × `style:…="tb-rl"` in 1 | 1 `loext:bt-lr` paragraph, 1 graphic, 1 `style:tb-rl` paragraph |
| `.ods` (307) | **none** | 1 `style:…="tb-rl"` on a paragraph |
| `.odp` (302) | **none** | 63 `loext:bt-lr` + 3 `tb-rl90` on `style:graphic-properties` in 5 and 3 documents; 414 `style:tb-rl` on paragraphs in 80 |

**So this fix reaches the `.odt` column alone, and that is a fact about where the attribute sits
rather than about which reader was changed.** `.ods` states no extension spelling anywhere and no
turned cell at all. `.odp` states 82 extension-namespace writing modes but **not one of them is on a
table cell** — they are on a *shape's* `style:graphic-properties`, which is a different object with a
different seat (`OdfFrames`/`OdpSlideLayout` feeding `SlideTextBody`, whose OOXML twin
`PptxTextBody` already models `WritingMode2::TB_RL` against `TB_RL90`). Closing the slides half is a
separate change and is left, named.

### What it was worth

**281 → 285 of 338 on its own**, four rows, eleven renderings moved and none lost: `047` (the row
frame growth cost round 75), `045`, `33004` and `A1. EASA Form 2`. The seven that keep their verdict
all hold a turned cell; `Sample_SQMS_Program` moves 85 960 → 85 730 glyphs against 86 734, which is
the one movement away from the reference and stays inside the band.

---

## 2. Fly splitting — and why the brief's account of the blocker is wrong

### What splitting is actually worth: six rows, not thirteen and not twenty-four

The brief carries round 75's *"13 further rows"* and round 77's *"24 failing rows"*. Both are
censuses of documents that **hold** a splittable fly. What matters is how many the reference
actually splits, and that is measurable at the reference with no layout reasoning at all: strip
`loext:may-break-between-pages` from the file, render the patched document through 26.2.4.2, and
compare its page and glyph counts against the reference's own rendering of the original. `unsplit.py`
does it; `unsplit.tsv` is the result.

Of the **20 failing rows that hold a splittable fly** at this round's writing-mode base, 26.2.4.2
splits **six**:

| document | reference | reference, unsplit | ours before | ours after |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `012_Project_Timeline…Black_and_Brown` | 2p/201 | 1p/201 | **1p/201** | 2p/201 |
| `015_Project_Timeline…Colored_Background` | 2p/211 | 1p/211 | **1p/211** | 2p/211 |
| `part-147_approval list_20230119` | 2p/3570 | 2p/**3161** | **2p/3161** | 2p/3563 |
| `Case-Study-Heathrow-Airport` | 3p/6461 | 1p/**2159** | **1p/2159** | 3p/6461 |
| `OM template for non-complex NCC operators` | 165p/268604 | 165p/268550 | 166p/268604 | 166p/268658 |
| `ESPN-R - MCF - RA - Ed1` | 58p/65952 | 40p/**42875** | 41p/42993 | 58p/65615 |

**On four of the six the reference with splitting turned off reproduces this tree's own output to
the page and to the glyph**, and on `ESPN-R` to one page and 118 glyphs of 42 875. That is as clean
a statement as this corpus offers that splitting was the *whole* of the gap on those documents and
nothing else was wrong with them.

The other fourteen are documents that state the attribute on a fly that fits; they were failing for
other reasons and still are, except `AFS-050-004-F2_0i` — see below.

### The blocker the brief names does not exist: this engine already splits a floating table

The brief describes three coupled pieces, of which the third — *"pages that no block created, and
obstacles keyed by page"* — is called architectural. **It is already built, and has been since the
round that closed `Case-Study-Heathrow-Airport.docx`.**

`Paginator.PlaceFloatedTable` (`Paginator.cs`:3388) places a **positioned block table** — OOXML's
`w:tblpPr`, which LibreOffice's DOCX importer turns into a fly holding a table — carries the rows the
page cannot take in `pendingFloats`, and `ContinueFloatedTables` (`:1972`) puts them at the top of
the next page's text area. When the body's flow has run out and rows are still waiting,
`while (tables.Count > 0 && …) FinishPage();` (`:1739`) **starts pages that no block created**. Its
own remarks name `012_Project_Timeline_Template_Black_and_Brown_Theme`, whose ninth row is the whole
of the reference's page 2. The comment at `:1734` reads *"The rest of a split fly, when the flow ran
out before it did."*

So the three pieces are not three:

1. **Read `loext:may-break-between-pages`** — one attribute, and the `draw:` spelling beside it
   (`xmloff/source/text/XMLTextFrameContext.cxx`:1104-1107 reads both into `IsSplitAllowed`;
   `xmloff/source/text/txtparae.cxx`:3115-3119 writes the extension one, and only when true).
2. **Slice the flow at the deadline** — *already done*, and done at row level, because the thing
   `PlaceFloatedTable` splits is a table.
3. **Put the continuation on the following pages, creating them if need be** — *already done*.

What was missing was none of those. **It was the reader**: `OdtLayoutSource` routed the object
through the frame path, where a `PageFrame` is placed whole by `FrameResolution` and its tail is
drawn off the bottom of the sheet. The fix is to read a `draw:frame` that holds nothing but a table
and says it may break as what it is — the same object a `.docx` spells `w:tblpPr`. In the reference's
own words, `sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/DomainMapperTableHandler.cxx`:1765: *"A text frame created
for floating tables is always allowed to split."* One object, two spellings; this tree already had
the model and the ODF reader was not using it.

`OdfFrames.FloatingTable` is the recogniser and `OdtLayoutSource.Floated` builds the positioned
table; the whole of it is about 120 lines of reader.

### Round 77's third piece is stronger than it was stated, and it is free

Round 77 added *"on the documents that actually matter the flow to be sliced **is a table**"*. That
is an understatement: censused over the whole column by `census.py`, **all 51 splittable flies in the
converted corpus hold a table and nothing else** — not one holds a paragraph. So a paragraph-flow
slicer would have reached nothing, and the row-level table splitting the engine already had is
exactly and only what the corpus needs. The `FloatingTable` recogniser therefore requires a
table-only text box and has no paragraph arm at all.

### The refusals, and the two document settings that decide the rest

`SwFlyFrame::IsFlySplitAllowed` (`sw/source/core/layout/fly.cxx`:689-737 — round 75's correction to
:730 stands) refuses for a fly that is not at-content, is in a header or footer, is in a
multi-column section, is in a footnote, or grows upwards from the body's bottom, and refuses
outright while `DocumentSettingId::DO_NOT_BREAK_WRAPPED_TABLES` holds (:696-700). The reader applies
the reachable ones: the anchor must be `paragraph` or `char`, and only the body walk lifts a fly out
— a header, a footer and a cell are read by the other two walks and are left alone.

**Two document settings decide more of this column than the attribute does, and neither was read.**

* **`TabOverMargin`** picks the *deadline* a split fly is cut at. `GetFlyAnchorBottom`
  (`fly.cxx`:113-162) has two arms and `isLegacyBehavior` (:101-110) chooses between them on
  `DocumentSettingId::TAB_OVER_MARGIN` together with the fly being page-relative: the Word ≤ 2010 arm
  is the **page's** bottom, limited so the fly still fits the body's height, and the Word ≥ 2013 arm
  is the body frame's print bottom. Absent means false (`mbTabOverMargin(false)`,
  `DocumentSettingManager.cxx`:92). **177 of the 338 `.odt` state it true and 161 false.** Reading it
  as absent split the three graph-paper templates onto a second page each: `080` draws its 49th grid
  rule at 779.4 pt on a body whose print bottom is 769.9, which is the overlap the legacy arm allows
  and the modern one does not. `PaginationOptions.FliesMayOverlapTheBottomMargin` already modelled
  the rule for DOCX (`compatibilityMode < 15`); the ODT path was taking `PaginationOptions.Default`'s
  false.
* **`DoNotBreakWrappedTables`** is a document-level veto over every `may-break-between-pages` the
  file states, tested before the fly is looked at at all. **30 of the 338 state it.**
  `SwXMLImport::SetConfigurationSettings` sets the property only when they do
  (`sw/source/filter/xml/xmlimp.cxx`:1627-1630), so absent is permissive.

### Where the fly is put

Censused over the 51 (`poscensus.py`): every one is anchored to a paragraph, every one states
`svg:y` with `style:vertical-pos="from-top"`, and none states `style:run-through`. The vertical
relation is `paragraph` 29, `page` 17, `page-content` 5 — which is exactly OOXML's
`w:vertAnchor` triple and maps onto `FrameVerticalOrigin.Paragraph`, `.Page` and `.PageMargin`. The
horizontal position is `center` 30, `from-left` 20, `right` 1, and `from-left` is the only value that
carries an `svg:x` — 20 of 20 do, and 31 of 31 of the others do not.

`style:horizontal-rel="page"` (8 of the 51) measures that offset from the **sheet's own left edge**
where every other length on the way to `PageTable` is measured from the text area's. That is the
same correction `DocxLayoutSource.PositionedLeftEdge` makes for `w:horzAnchor="page"`, and it needs
one piece of page geometry the ODF reader did not carry — the section's left margin, now passed in.
`Case-Study-Heathrow-Airport` is the witness on both sides: its `.docx` states `w:tblpX="705"` and
its `.odt` `svg:x="0.4862in"`, which are the same 35.0 pt from the sheet.

### What it cost, and the one loss

Six of the ten gains are this change: `Heathrow`, `ESPN-R`, `part-147`, `012`, `015` and
`AFS-050-004-F2_0i`. **`AFS` is not a split** — the unsplit experiment says the reference does not
split it — and it comes right because the positioned-table path places the fly where the file says
while the frame path did not; that is worth knowing, because it means the reader change is worth a
row beyond the splitting it was written for.

`slcc-architecture-uu-architecture` is the loss, 4/4 → 3/4 pages at an unchanged glyph count, and it
is understood rather than merely observed. Instrumenting `PlaceFloatedTable` on it gives
`used=656.60 top=656.65 height=275.05 origin=Paragraph runsInto=True fills=True`, so the paginator's
own guard fires — *"a `w:vertAnchor="text"` fly sits where the flow already is"*, measured by the
DOCX round on this very document — and **refuses to float it**, leaving the table in the flow. In the
flow it comes to 3 pages; floated (tested by bypassing the guard) it also comes to 3; as a frame it
came to 4. So neither arm of the positioned-table model reproduces it and the frame path did, by
accident of the wrap: a frame is an obstacle and pushes the flow down, and a positioned table never
does that for a paragraph-anchored fly. `ESPN-R` states **the identical** geometry —
`svg:y="0.0008in"`, `vrel=paragraph`, `svg:x="-0.0035in"`, `hrel=paragraph` — and gains 17 pages, so
no reader-side rule separates the two. Left, named, with its instrumented numbers.

### The one accommodation, stated as one

A fly whose offset from its own anchor paragraph is **negative** starts above the paragraph it hangs
on — a place the flow has already passed — and a positioned block table is placed at
`used + VerticalOffset`, so the model would put it behind the text rather than over it. Such a fly is
left in its frame. This is a limit of the model stated where it bites rather than a rule of Writer's,
which simply draws the fly there. Measured on `HC-Bulletin-template`, whose second fly states
`svg:y="-0.078in"`: hoisted it is cut 18.9 pt above the body's bottom and the document comes to six
pages, and left in its frame it is **five against the reference's five**, glyph-exact. Two of the 51
state a negative offset against their paragraph, and the reference splits neither.

---

## What this brief got wrong, and what this round refuted

* **"That is three coupled changes… the seat is `FrameResolution.ObstaclesFor(int block)` and
  `Paginator._obstacles`, which have to become per *page*."** No part of that was needed. The
  engine has split a floating table across pages — and started pages of its own to do it — since the
  round that closed `Case-Study-Heathrow-Airport.docx`; `Paginator.cs`:1734-1739 and :1972-1999 are
  the seat, and its own comments name `012`. What was missing was a reader that recognised the ODF
  spelling of the object. **Neither obstacle keying nor page creation was touched by this round.**

* **The reach was overstated by both prior rounds, and the instrument that settles it is the
  reference itself.** Round 75 measured 13 rows by comparing held text against drawn text; round 77
  measured 24 rows that *touch* a splittable fly (this round measures 20 at its own base). The number
  that matters is **6** — the rows 26.2.4.2 actually splits — established by stripping the attribute
  and re-rendering. A document that states `may-break-between-pages` on a fly that fits is not a
  splitting document.

* **"A glyph count reads *missing* where the defect is *unsplit*" is right, and the obvious
  instrument cannot see it.** Heathrow's page-one text does reach `y = −945.6` and `ESPN-R`'s page 41
  reaches −6732.1. But **PyMuPDF's `get_text` clips to the page** — asked for text outside the sheet
  it reports a handful of descender-sized overhangs and none of this — and a content-stream scan that
  matches only `Tm` finds **one** document in 338, because Writer's PDF writer positions most text
  objects with `Td`. `tdrange.py` matches both and finds 30; `offsheet.py` and `tmrange.py` are kept
  as the record of the two wrong instruments. This round very nearly published *"round 77's
  observation no longer holds"* on the strength of the `Tm`-only scan.

* **`fly.cxx`:689-737 is right** (round 75's correction to the brief's :730 stands, re-checked line
  by line here), and so is `DomainMapperTableHandler.cxx`:1765.

* **`loext:may-break-between-pages` is on the `draw:frame` element, not on its graphic style.**
  Round 75's census phrasing — *"51 of the 59 declare `loext:may-break-between-pages="true"`"* —
  counts frames correctly but reads as a style property; it is an attribute of the element, which is
  why `OdfFrames.FloatingTable` takes it off the element and the graphic style is consulted only for
  the position.

* **`047`'s turned cells were not a frame-growth defect and the row was not lost to growth.** Round
  75 recorded the lost row as the cost of frame growth exposed by a cell-rotation defect. The cell
  reading alone closes it — 2/1 pages → **1/1**, 221 → 224 of 225 — with no change to growth at all.

* **The `bt-lr` cell reading is not an `.odp` or `.ods` fix in disguise.** The brief asks whether it
  reaches the sheets and slides readers. It does not, and the reason is not that they were skipped:
  `.ods` states no extension writing mode anywhere and no turned cell, and every one of `.odp`'s 82
  extension writing modes is on a *shape's* graphic properties rather than on a cell.

## What is left, with its seat

* **`slcc-architecture-uu-architecture`**, above: a positioned table cannot push the flow down the
  way a frame's obstacle does, and on this one document that is worth a page. Seat
  `Paginator.PlaceFloatedTable`'s `RunsIntoTheFly` guard and `FrameObstacles`.
* **A shape that over-draws.** Seven `chartset` templates draw 3 % to 43 % more than the reference —
  `051_Organogram_Template_Basic_Theme` 86 characters against 60, `031_Venn_Diagram` 304 against
  249, `040_Venn_Diagram` 294 against 240, `055_Organogram` 470 against 402, `011_Project_Timeline`
  993 against 885, `016` 653 against 633, `018` 442 against 421 — and their shapes carry
  `draw:auto-grow-height="false"` with an `fo:min-height`. That is the `draw:custom-shape` autofit
  and clip rule round 75 also left; untouched here.
* **`A_320.odt`, 134 pages against 118**, and the `150_5300_13_*` family with it. Untouched.
* **The slides half of the vertical writing mode**: 63 `loext:writing-mode="bt-lr"` and 3
  `tb-rl90` on `style:graphic-properties` in 5 and 3 of the 302 `.odp`, plus 414 `style:tb-rl` on
  paragraph properties in 80. `SlideTextBody`; `PptxTextBody`:273-284 is the OOXML model of the same
  distinction.
* **`tb-lr` as a third cell direction**, measured here and not modelled: 26.2.4.2 turns it clockwise
  and stacks the lines rightwards. Zero corpus reach.

## Nothing else moved

| track | rows | differing on pages, glyphs, fonts or verdict |
|---|---:|---:|
| original `.docx`/`.doc` words, against `/home/user/gate-orig-r81` | 338 | **0** |
| converted `.rtf`, against `/home/user/gate-odf-r78` | 338 | **0** |

The original track stands at 315 match / 20 pages / 2 pages,words / 1 words, which is its banked
baseline exactly, and the `.rtf` column reproduces its banked rows row for row.

That is what the code predicts. Both changes are in the ODF word-processing reader —
`OdtLayoutSource`, `OdtLayoutSource.Tables`, `OdfFrames` and the two options `OdtWordDocument` passes
— which only `odt`, `ott` and `fodt` construct; and the one shared file that was touched,
`Paginator`, was touched only by reverting the instrumentation this round added to it (`git diff`
over it is empty). The measurement is the check on that reasoning rather than a substitute for it.

## Verification

Full build `dotnet build Paperless.slnx -v q -nologo`: **0 warnings, 0 errors.**

The ten non-fidelity projects, run individually:

| project | passed | failed |
|---|---:|---:|
| Containers | 109 | 0 |
| Core | 516 | 0 |
| Markup | 259 | 0 |
| OpenDocument | 143 | 0 |
| Presentations | 1005 | 0 |
| Rendering | 164 | 0 |
| Spreadsheets | 1198 | 0 |
| Text | 727 | 0 |
| Vector | 302 | 0 |
| WordProcessing | **1787** | 0 |
| **total** | **6210** | **0** |

6194 before, plus this round's sixteen assertions — five in `OdtTurnedCellTests`, five in
`OdtFloatingTableTests` and six theory cases in `OdtFlySettingsTests`. Every other project reports
its briefed count unchanged.

`Paperless.Fidelity.Tests` with `/opt/libreoffice26.2/program` first on `PATH`: **542 passed, 10
failed, 0 skipped of 552** — the ten known-open, named, and no others:

```
PageDrawingComparisonTests.EveryLineIsDrawnWhereLibreOfficeDrawsIt   paginated.{doc,docx,fodt,rtf}
TabStopComparisonTests.AListLabelsTabAdvancesToLibreOfficesStop      list-label-overrun.{doc,docx,fodt,odt}
SheetDrawingComparisonTests.APictureIsDrawnWhereLibreOfficeDrawsIt   sheet-rich-text.xlsx
JustificationShrinkComparisonTests.TheParagraphBreaksWhereLibreOfficeBreaksIt  justify-shrink-2013.docx
```

Run twice; the same ten both times.

Fixtures and tests added:

| fixture | test |
|---|---|
| `odt-turned-cell.fodt` | `OdtTurnedCellTests` |
| `odt-floating-table.fodt`, `odt-floating-table-whole.fodt` | `OdtFloatingTableTests` |
| — | `OdtFlySettingsTests` |

Each fixture was rendered through 26.2.4.2 and its assertions are that rendering's own numbers,
quoted per assertion. `OdtFlySettingsTests` deliberately has no fixture: a minimal hand-authored flat
ODF's `office:settings` is ignored outright by 26.2.4.2, so it asserts the reader against the C++
defaults instead, and the reference's evidence for the rule is the corpus documents in §2.

## Files

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `gen.py` | the eleven authored flat-ODF writing-mode probes |
| `probes/*.fodt` | those probes as generated |
| `render.sh` | one reference render, in a profile keyed on a hex digest of the path, under `timeout -k` |
| `read.py`, `probe-reading.txt` | reads each probe's runs with their direction vectors; its output |
| `census.py`, `split-census.txt` | every growing frame, whether it may break, and what it holds |
| `poscensus.py` | the positioning every splittable floating table states |
| `unsplit.py`, `unsplit.tsv` | the reference rendered with the attribute stripped — what splitting is worth |
| `unsplit-control.txt` | the six the reference splits, against this tree before and after |
| `tdrange.py`, `td-base.tsv` | text drawn below the sheet, read off `Td` **and** `Tm` |
| `belowsheet.py`, `below-base.tsv` | how many glyphs of it there are, per document |
| `tmrange.py`, `offsheet.py` | the two instruments that answered wrongly; kept as the record |
| `rows-before.tsv` | the `.odt` column at `e6be864e4` |
| `rows-writingmode.tsv` | with the cell writing mode alone |
| `rows-after.tsv` | with both changes |
| `rows-split-firstcut.tsv` | the intermediate cut, before the two document settings were read |
| `movers.txt` | every row that moved, with its verdict either side |
