r"""Which of the 338 converted `.rtf` this round's change actually moves, byte for byte.

`reach-census.py` counts the documents that *declare and apply* a name the round adds. That is
not reach: round 95 closed O9 with two documents applying `Body Text` and **neither moving**,
because each entry states its own `\fs` and the reset writes RTF's default back over it. So the
number that belongs in a write-up is the one this script produces — documents whose rendering
changes — and the census is only the shortlist it explains.

Each document is rendered with `Paperless.Cli render --format pdf`, hashed, and the PDF deleted
immediately, so the sweep's disk cost is one PDF at a time rather than 338. `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`
is pinned, so two runs of the same binary over the same file are byte-identical (checked before
the sweep, not assumed) and a hash difference between two legs is a real difference.

    PAPERLESS_CLI=<abs path> reach-sweep.py <corpus root> <out.tsv> [workers]

Run it once at the base commit and once at HEAD, then `diff` the two `.tsv`.
