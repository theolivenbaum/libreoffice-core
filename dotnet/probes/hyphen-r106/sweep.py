"""Render every corpus document with our own CLI, hash the result, and keep no PDF.

Two legs from ONE binary: PAPERLESS_HYPHEN_DICTS=0 is the no-dictionary state, which is
byte-for-byte the behaviour before this seat because ChartAxisLabels asks Hyphenators.For,
which answers null when the variable turns the shipped file off. Running one binary twice
removes the rebuild-under-a-sweep trap dotnet/CLAUDE.md records, at the cost of needing a
separate check that the off leg really equals a base-built binary -- which is done on three
documents by hand.

Disk is the reason nothing is kept: 947 PDFs twice does not fit in what is free. Each
render is hashed and deleted; the movers are re-rendered afterwards, and only those.
