"""Score one document's two renderings against 26.2.4.2's banked one.

    score-movers.py <movers.txt> <out.tsv>

For each document it renders our side twice from ONE binary -- PAPERLESS_HYPHEN_DICTS=0 for
the hyphenator-off leg and unset for the shipped default -- and compares each against the
reference PDF banked in /home/user/gate-orig-r83/ref, which was produced by
/opt/libreoffice26.2/program/soffice (LibreOffice 26.2.4.2).

The column that decides is |ink|% -- the UNSIGNED per-page ink distance summed over pages,
from the render-comparison skill's pdf-image-diff.py. Ranking on a signed sum lets a page
where we draw too much cancel one where we draw too little; ranking on path or operator
counts is what once called 44 of 48 documents defective.

`glyphs` is the gate's own column 9: alphanumeric CHARACTERS out of pdftotext, ours against
the reference, with the gate's max(2%, 15) band.
