"""Measure where a table's row boundaries drift against the reference's.

      5      29.280      29.400    +0.120    146.040    146.280   +0.240
      …
     23      29.400      29.400    +0.000    686.880    687.960   +1.080
     24      19.680      18.600    -1.080    706.560    706.560   +0.000

**The reference alternates 29.280 and 29.400 on rows that are identical in the
file; we always give 29.400.** The step between them is 0.120 pt, which is
exactly one pixel at 600 dpi — the printer reference device this container
resolves (see `CLAUDE.md`, and `LineSpacing.cs`'s `RefDevMode`).

**CORRECTION, made before anything was built on the first reading.** The
paragraph that stood here said LibreOffice snaps row *boundaries* while we snap
each row *height*, and that the rounding order was the defect. Half of that is
right and the half that matters is not.

The reference does snap boundaries — every one is a whole number of 600 dpi
pixels (58.080/0.12 = 484, 87.360/0.12 = 728, 706.560/0.12 = 5888). But
**rounding order alone oscillates; it cannot accumulate monotonically.** Ours
grows in one direction to +1.080 pt over 24 rows, and that is only possible if
the height itself differs.

Averaging the reference's sixteen uniform body rows gives its exact height:

    reference mean pitch   29.3475 pt   (alternating 29.280 and 29.400)
    our pitch              29.4000 pt
    per-row excess         +0.0525 pt   ->  +1.26 pt over 24 rows

29.3475 pt is **244.56** pixels at 600 dpi, which is exactly why the reference
alternates between 244 and 245 while ours is 245 every time.

So **our auto row height is about 0.05 pt too tall**, and the quantisation makes
that visible rather than causing it. These rows carry `w:spacing w:line="233"
w:lineRule="auto"` — proportional spacing at 97.08%, *below* 100 — so the seat is
a line height under sub-unity proportional spacing, adjacent to the
base-membership rule fixed the same day but not the same bug. Only 12 of the
document's 305 rows declare a `w:trHeight`; the rest are auto, so the line height
is the whole of it.

Two things make this worth chasing rather than filing as cosmetic:

- **The table total is right.** Both sides end at 706.560 — the last row
  absorbs the whole accumulated error. So nothing about the table's own extent
  is wrong, and no measurement of a *complete* table would ever show it. It is
  visible only inside the table, which is why it has survived.
- **It decides pagination.** A table cut across a page boundary is cut at a row
  boundary, and a boundary that sits 1 pt low is a row that does not fit. That
  is exactly the shape of the remaining `mcar` failures — `02_mcar` 314/312 and
  `SPA-02` 268/266, both pages-only with words in band, both diverging first
  inside a long table.

Distinct from the advance-width divergence in `CLAUDE.md`'s third absolute
rule. That one is horizontal, per-glyph, face-dependent and needs a hinted
advance; this is vertical, per-row, and is a question of *what gets rounded*
rather than of what the value is.

Reads full-width horizontal rules out of a 600 dpi rasterisation of one page —
600 because the step being measured is one pixel at that resolution, and a
coarser raster cannot see it. An earlier pass at 150 dpi showed the same rows
as `61, 61, 62, 61` and looked like noise.
