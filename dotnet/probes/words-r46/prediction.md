# Words round 46 — the prediction, committed before anything is rendered post-change

Baseline reproduced exactly at `ee87a6d0e` (`baseline.tsv`, 200 rows, no duplicate paths):
157/200 matching, |page error| 75, 167 exactly-correct page counts, |word error| 6602.

## The change

`WordParagraphFormats` gives a DOCX paragraph `OrphanLines = WidowLines = 2` when
`word/styles.xml` carries a `w:docDefaults/w:pPrDefault` element — **empty or not** — and nothing
in the chain (that element's own `w:pPr`, the style chain, the paragraph) turns `w:widowControl`
off. Today `IsOn` returns false for an absent element, so a DOCX paragraph has no widow or orphan
control unless something switches it on, which almost nothing does.

Established against the installed 24.2.7.2 by nine authored variants at five straddle positions
(`widow-orphan-default.py`), with `para-off` measuring the room at the foot of the page so a
variant that keeps fewer lines there is one with the control on:

| variant | behaves like |
|---|---|
| `no-docDefaults`, `no-pPrDefault` | control **off** |
| `empty-pPrDefault`, `pPrDefault-with-pPr` | control **on**, identical to `para-on` |
| `pPrDefault-widow-off` (docDefaults state `w:val="0"`) | control **off** |
| `pPrDefault-para-off` (paragraph states `w:val="0"`) | control **off** |
| `settings-on` (`w:settings/w:widowControl`) | control **off** — the document-level flag does nothing |

## What the census counts, and what it cannot see

`widow-orphan-census.py` over `words/batch-*`: **130 of 134 DOCX** carry a `w:pPrDefault`; four
have one that turns the flag off; none lack it. The remaining **66 documents are `.doc`**, which
this change does not touch at all — `Ww8LayoutFormat` already reads `HasWidowControl ?? true`, so
the binary half has had widow and orphan control all along. That asymmetry between the two readers
is what raised the question.

**The census counts documents whose paragraphs gain the property, not documents whose output
moves.** It cannot see:

- whether any paragraph in a document ever *straddles* a page break — a one-line paragraph, a
  heading, a list item and a table cell that never splits all pay nothing;
- the ODF reader (`fo:orphans`/`fo:widows`, already read) or the RTF reader (document-level
  `\widowctrl`, unchanged), neither of which is in this track's corpus in any number;
- a paragraph whose split is already forbidden by `w:keepLines` or by a table row rule, where
  adding an orphan count changes nothing;
- the interaction with the round-45 line-spacing rule, which changed where 11 documents' lines
  land and therefore which of them straddle at all.

So 130 is a ceiling on the population and says nothing about the reach.

## The numbers predicted

| | baseline `ee87a6d0e` | predicted |
|---|---:|---|
| documents matching | 157 | **154–161** |
| absolute page error | 75 | **62–82** |
| exactly-correct page counts | 167 | **162–173** |
| absolute word error | 6602 | 6450–6750 |
| renderings changed | — | **55–100 of 200** |

The bands are wide on purpose and the reason is the sign. Widow and orphan control only ever
*moves content down*, so our page counts can only rise. The baseline's page-delta histogram is
14 documents at −1, 7 at +1, 2 at −2, 3 at +2 and a tail: the change should help roughly twice as
many documents as it hurts, and a net gain of two or three verdicts is the central expectation.
A net **loss** is a real possibility and would not by itself refute the rule — the probes establish
what the reference does, and a document that goes red because a compensating error is exposed is
the round-45 `gpp` case again, to be judged on page error and exact-page count rather than on the
verdict.

The one document the rule was found on, `gpp-pr-top-7-office-markets-4q-2023.docx`, is predicted
to go 3/4 → **4/4** and back to `match`: mutating its "In the year 2023 …" paragraph to
`w:widowControl w:val="0"` puts that line back on page 1 in the reference, which is the causal
test.

## What would refute the rule

- A sweep in which the DOCX half of the corpus gets *worse* on both page error and exact-page
  count while the `.doc` half is untouched. The probes would still stand, and the reading "the
  default is 2" would have to be wrong in some way the nine variants do not reach — most likely
  in *how* Writer applies the counts rather than in whether it has them.
- Any authored variant where an empty `w:pPrDefault` fails to turn the control on. None of the
  five straddle positions did.

# The second change, predicted before its sweep

Baseline for this one is the tree after the widow/orphan commit: **158/200**, |page error| 67,
168 exactly-correct page counts, |word error| 6695 (`after-widow-orphan.tsv`).

## The change

`MeasuredParagraph.MeasureLine` no longer lets a line's *text* descent count when the line holds
no text — a line whose characters are all non-printing controls and which carries an as-character
object. Round 45 left this open in exactly those words; `picture-alone-descent.py` closes it by
authoring the shape in **both** DOCX and flat ODF and measuring both against the installed
24.2.7.2:

| shape | picture | LibreOffice | before |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| docx alone | 20 / 50 / 150 pt | 33.80 / 63.80 / 163.80 | **+2.60 each** |
| docx with text | 20 / 50 / 150 pt | 36.40 / 66.40 / 166.40 | exact |
| fodt alone | 20 / 50 / 150 pt | 33.80 / 63.80 / 163.80 | exact |
| docx & fodt alone | 5 pt | 27.60 / 18.80 | exact |

The two formats agree to 0.00 pt in all eight pairs, so **it was never a format difference**: the
fixture `MeasuredParagraph` cites, `picture-anchor.fodt`, has text on the picture's line, so it is
the with-text row. The 5 pt rows are what say the paragraph font still *floors* the line, which is
why only the descent is dropped and not the whole fallback.

## What the census counts and cannot see

`picture-only-paragraph-census.py`: **76 of 134 DOCX** carry at least one paragraph whose whole
content is an inline picture, 281 such paragraphs in all. It reads `word/document.xml`, the headers
and the footers of a zip container only, so it cannot see the **66 `.doc`**, which the change
reaches identically; nor a picture that ends up alone on a line of a longer paragraph; nor — the
one that decides the reach — **whether 2.6 pt ever moved a page break.** A logo above a heading is
2.6 pt short on every page it appears on and moves nothing.

## Predicted

| | after widow/orphan | predicted |
|---|---:|---|
| documents matching | 158 | **156–161** |
| absolute page error | 67 | **60–72** |
| exactly-correct page counts | 168 | **165–172** |
| absolute word error | 6695 | 6550–6800 |
| renderings changed | — | **25–70 of 200** |

The sign is the opposite of the first change's: this one makes pages *shorter*, so our page counts
can only fall. The 13 documents still at −1 are the ones it can hurt and the 7 at +1 are the ones
it can help, so a small net loss of verdicts is as likely as a gain and the aggregate is again the
check.

`Paperless.Text` is a shared layer below all three families, so a cross-track measurement is owed
and will be made by rendering slides and sheets whole at the widow/orphan commit and at this one,
with `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` pinned and `/CreationDate` normalised. **A non-zero count there is not
automatically a regression** — a deck with an as-character picture alone on a line is the same
defect — but it is a result that has to be reported either way.
