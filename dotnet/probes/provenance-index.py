"""Index every stored probe figure by the environment that produced it.

Why this exists
---------------

Stored evidence on this project decays silently while continuing to look
authoritative. Three separate cases surfaced in one day: a `words-after.tsv`
carrying numbers from a sweep that overlapped a rebuild; a "39/39 exact" CJK fit
measured on a face whose line gap is zero, so it could not have discriminated;
and a "exact on all 96" advance probe that is 16 of 96 against today's binary.

The census that motivated this file is the sharp version of the same point:

    prose write-ups naming a LibreOffice version   122 of 154
    stored TSVs recording any environment at all     3 of 256

The write-up says what it was measured against. The *data* does not — and the
data is what a later round greps, pastes into a brief and acts on. A TSV is a
grid of numbers with no way to tell a reader that its reference bank no longer
exists.

What it does NOT do
-------------------

It does not rewrite the probe files. `dotnet/CLAUDE.md` is explicit that the
archival scripts and their output are *the record of what a given round actually
ran*, and rewriting them would falsify it. A `#` header prepended to a TSV would
also break every consumer that reads line 1 as the column names.

So this writes a **sidecar**: one index, beside the data, that nothing parses and
anything can read.

Eras
----

One boundary matters, and it is sharp. On 2026-08-13 the project moved
containers in commit 4cbaeb41c3b ("Adapt the tree to the new container, and bank
the reference half of the gate"), and a5d453fae3f the same day established that
`fonts-dejavu-core` had been missing ("The gate's inputs include the font set,
and nothing declared it"). Both inputs to the gate changed together:

    before 2026-08-13   LibreOffice 24.2.7.2, font set unverified
    2026-08-13 onward   LibreOffice 26.2.4.2, fonts-dejavu-core present

Neither half of that is cosmetic. Re-rendering the reference across the version
change moved 63 of 534 page counts and put 210 of 534 word counts outside the
gate's own band; holding the version constant and varying only the font set
moved 53 of 534 page counts on its own. A figure from the earlier era is not
stale in the sense of "slightly old" — it was measured against a reference bank
this container cannot reproduce.

Usage
-----

    python3 dotnet/probes/provenance-index.py            # write PROVENANCE.tsv
    python3 dotnet/probes/provenance-index.py --check    # exit 1 if out of date

Re-run it after adding probe output, or the index is itself an instance of the
problem it documents.
