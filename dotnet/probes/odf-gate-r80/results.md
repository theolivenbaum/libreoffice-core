## Read this table like-for-like, not on the totals

This run scored `.ods` **225** where `odf-gate-r78` scored 234, and nothing regressed. Eight of the
nine lost rows are **`ref-failed`** — the *reference* timed out — and the ninth is `ours-failed` on
`Global_Market_Forecast…ods`, which `ods-page-r77` already measured at 210 s alone against the
240 s bound. Three rounds were building and sweeping in their own worktrees throughout. The tell is
`REF-CANNOT-RENDER`, which went **2 → 13**.

Excluding the 15 rows that failed on either side in either run:

| column | r78 `873c766f9` | r80 `995e83aa3` | of |
|---|---:|---:|---:|

| `.ods` | 225 | 225 | 294 |
| `.rtf` | 257 | 257 | 336 |

**No row that matched at r78 is a genuine mismatch at r80.** The `.odp` +6 is `odp-embed-r79`'s,
reproduced independently here.
