"""Where does 26.2.4.2 get `013`'s page-1 camera picture from?

Round 54 varied the *DrawingML* side of `013_Contextures_chart_sample` -- `editAs`,
`a:ext/@cx`, the anchor's `to` column -- and the reference did not move for any of them.
A null result from an instrument that cannot register the effect is not evidence of
absence, so this probe varies the **other** side: the worksheet's legacy VML drawing.

Reading of `oox`'s source that this is meant to confirm or refute on the binary:

  * `ContextHandler2Helper::prepareMceContext` (oox/source/core/contexthandler2.cxx)
    lists the MCE namespaces oox supports and `a14` is explicitly **not** on it
    (`// u"a14", // We do not currently support ...`). `013`'s whole `xdr:twoCellAnchor`
    sits inside `mc:Choice Requires="a14"` beside an **empty** `mc:Fallback`, so on this
    reading Calc reads *no* DrawingML anchor at all -- which is exactly why round 54's
    three variants were inert.
  * The picture then comes from `xl/drawings/vmlDrawing1.vml`, reached by the sheet's
    `legacyDrawing` relationship. `VmlDrawing::isShapeSupported` (sc) excludes only
    `XML_Note`, so a `Pict` is imported.
  * `ShapeBase::calcShapeRectangle` (oox/source/vml/vmlshape.cxx:509-516) prefers the
    `x:ClientData/x:Anchor` cell anchor over the shape's `style` width/height.

Each variant changes exactly one thing, and each has a *stated* expected direction, so a
"nothing moved" answer refutes rather than merely failing to confirm.
