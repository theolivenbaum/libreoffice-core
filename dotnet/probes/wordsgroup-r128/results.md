# A picture's own geometry, a TOC switch that eats direct formatting, and two refutations

Round 128, `/home/user/wt-wordsgroup`, branch `agent/wordsgroup`, base `bdfa0c947`, 2026-09-14.

| | |
|---|---|
| reference | `/opt/libreoffice26.2/program/soffice` — **26.2.4.2**, `0229ac93fcf0d7cbc6376066c6f35021cef002dc` |
| our renderer | `dotnet/tools/Paperless.Cli` built in this worktree, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1757462400` |
| C++ tree | `/home/user/libreoffice-core`, read only — **C8**: it declares `27.2.0.0.alpha0+` and is not the reference binary's source, so every arm below is confirmed a second time against 26.2.4.2's own output |
| `/usr/bin/soffice` | 24.2.7.2 — not used for anything in this round |
| corpus | `/home/user/sample-files`, 947 documents, of which 272 `docx` |

Every reference rendering quoted here was produced fresh in this round; none is a banked figure.
No full-corpus sweep was run, so nothing here contends with the two live rounds.

**Seat numbers.** The brief named O76 as the next free seat. Round 127 landed while this round was
working and took O76 and O77, so **every row proposed here was renumbered from O78 up at the
coordinator's instruction** — O78 and O79 are this round's seats, O80 its closed one. There is no
lost seat in the gap.

**On applying a factor.** Round 127's warning — that a single ratio on two documents invites a
constant, and that its own blanket Escher rescale would have taken 92 presets matching the
reference down to 68 — is exactly the trap §0 walks into and out of. **No factor was applied here.**
The ~8.85 was derived to the fourth decimal before anything was changed, it turned out to be
`1/(1 − l − r)` of each picture's own `a:srcRect` rather than a group scale, and the group
transform proved right to 0.09 pt against the reference's own image placements. The change that
shipped adds a clip and rescales nothing. The identity case is checked the way round 127 asks:
`self-vrt.txt` renders all 35 documents that could possibly be reached, before and after, and
compares the PDFs byte for byte — 31 are bit-identical and the 4 that move are the 4 the census
predicted.

**Two of the three items ended by refuting the round that seated them, and both refutations are
recorded below rather than deleted.** Item 1's documents are drawn wrongly, but not for the reason
they were seated for; item 3's mechanism does not exist in this tree at all.

---

## 0. The instrument that made item 1 look nine times worse than it is

Round 124 reported that `075_Storyboard_Template_Fillable_Format.docx` and
`079_Storyboard_Template_Simple_Format.docx` draw a nested group's members "1548 pt wide from
x = −1111 on a 612 pt page", ~8.85× too wide and "mostly off the paper". That figure comes from
`page.get_image_info()`, which reports the **placement box of the image XObject** — the rectangle
the `cm` matrix maps the unit square onto — and says nothing about the clip in force when it is
drawn. It is the same quantity `probes/ink-hunt-r124/offpage-census.py` sums.

For a **cropped** picture the placement box is *deliberately* larger than the frame: a crop is
expressed as a bigger destination plus a clip (`PageDrawing.DrawPicture`, and the rule
`FramePictureCropTests` pins). Both documents crop every picture heavily, and 8.85 is exactly the
reciprocal of the crop:

| document | `a:srcRect` | visible fraction across | `1/fx` | measured box ÷ stated |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|
| `075` picture 30 | `l=72870 t=5287 r=15789 b=78749` | 0.11341 | **8.8176** | 1548.36 ÷ 175.6 = **8.820** |
| `075` picture 27 | `l=72882 t=28985 r=15745 b=55678` | 0.11373 | 8.7928 | 1544.45 ÷ 175.6 = 8.795 |
| `075` picture 32 | `l=73043 t=53566 r=15501 b=30461` | 0.11456 | 8.7291 | 1540.68 ÷ 176.5 = 8.729 |
| `075` picture 33 | `l=73043 t=78778 r=15745 b=5461` | 0.11212 | 8.9190 | 1565.73 ÷ 175.6 = 8.917 |
| `079` picture 10 | `l=1256 t=16331 r=76137 b=59275` | 0.22607 | 4.4234 | 898.84 ÷ 203.15 = 4.425 |

**And the pictures are clipped back to the right rectangle.** Our content stream for `075` is

```
16.85 562.45 175.6 152.05 re  W n
q  1548.3643 0 0 952.4555 -1111.4431 -187.5992 cm  /Im1 Do  Q
```

against 26.2.4.2's own `q 175.55 0 0 152 16.85 562.539 cm /Im8 Do` — the clip and the reference's
placement agree to **0.09 pt** in all four coordinates, on all four pictures of `075` and all four
of `079`. So the outer *and* nested group transforms are right, the composition is right, and
**"the factor comes from a nested `wpg:wgp`" is refuted.** `probes/words-group-transform`'s model
has no hole here; its census correctly does not list either document.

The lesson round 124 drew — that coverage finds what magnitude hides — still stands, and these two
documents are still wrong. But the magnitude it reported was the instrument's, and the general
form of the trap is worth keeping: **an image's placement box is not where the image is drawn, and
any census built on it over-reports every cropped picture in the corpus.**

---

## 1. FIXED — a picture's `a:prstGeom` never reached the clip, so a photograph in a circle came out square

### What the reference draws

26.2.4.2 emits the shape's **outline** as a clip path immediately before the image operator. On
`079` page 1:

```
q 368.3 628.99 m … 571.5 628.99 c … h  W* n
q 203.15 0 0 160.3 368.35 548.889 cm  /Im7 Do Q
```

Twelve cubics — an ellipse. We emitted `368.3 548.8 203.2 160.35 re W n`, the bounding box. The
four pictures of `079` each state `<a:prstGeom prst="ellipse"/>` in their own `pic:spPr`, and so do
the four of `075`.

### The rule, confirmed twice

**In source** (`/home/user/libreoffice-core`, `27.2.0.0.alpha0+`, not the reference's own tree):
`Shape::createAndInsert` (`oox/source/drawingml/shape.cxx`:1046-1051, 1086-1090)

```cpp
// Use custom shape instead of GraphicObjectShape if the image is cropped to
// shape. Except rectangle, which does not require further cropping
bool bIsCroppedGraphic = (aServiceName == "com.sun.star.drawing.GraphicObjectShape" &&
                          !mpCustomShapePropertiesPtr->representsDefaultShape());
```

and `representsDefaultShape` (`oox/source/drawingml/customshapeproperties.cxx`:123-128) is false
exactly when the shape names a preset other than `rect` **or** carries an `a:custGeom` path list.
The bitmap then becomes a custom shape's fill and the geometry bounds it.

**Against 26.2.4.2's own output**, on three fixtures that differ in one attribute
(`probes/wordsgroup-r128/mk-shaped-picture.py`, now `tests/corpus/features/picture-shaped*.docx`):

| fixture | `pic:spPr` geometry | what 26.2.4.2 emits before `Do` |
|---|---|---|
| `picture-shaped.docx` | `prst="ellipse"` | `72 612 m … c … h W* n` — the ellipse |
| `picture-shaped-crop.docx` | `prst="ellipse"` + the `a:srcRect` of `picture-crop.docx` | the same ellipse |
| `picture-shaped-rect.docx` | `prst="rect"` | `72 504 288 216 re W* n` |

### The fix

`PageDrawing.DrawFrame` already computes the frame's filled outline for the fill; it now hands it to
`DrawPicture`, which clips to it when there is one and to the frame's rectangle when there is a crop
and no outline. `SlideDrawing.DrawPicture` has clipped to `shape.Outline` all along and says why in
its own remarks — this closes a cross-format asymmetry rather than inventing a rule.

### Before and after, on every document the change can reach

`|ink|%` at 512 px on the long edge against a fresh 26.2.4.2 rendering:

| document | before | after | verdict |
|---|--:|--:|---|
| `079_Storyboard_Template_Simple_Format` | **1.67** | **0.16** | MAJOR → **ok** |
| `075_Storyboard_Template_Fillable_Format` | **0.71** | **0.38** | shifted → **ok** |
| `050_Visual_Product_Roadmap_Template_Yellow_and_Blue_Theme` | 0.46 | 0.40 | MAJOR → MAJOR (unrelated: ink we draw at the top centre) |
| `063_Foot_Reflexology_Chart_Complete_Guide` | 0.14 | 0.14 | MAJOR → MAJOR (one `roundRect`; its corners are below the raster) |

Nothing regresses, and `079` leaves the MAJOR set.

### Reach, with its base rate

`pic-preset-census.py` over all 947 corpus documents counts every `pic:pic` whose own `spPr` states
a non-`rect` `a:prstGeom` or an `a:custGeom`:

**78 shaped pictures in 9 documents, 0 of them `custGeom`** — `roundRect` 66, `ellipse` 9,
`round2SameRect` 2, `round2DiagRect` 1. Of those, **70 in 7 `pptx`**, which the slide side already
draws correctly, and **8 in 2 `docx`**, which are exactly the two documents round 124 named.

`shaped-picture-census.py` widens it to every way a *words* document can put a picture in a
non-rectangular outline — `pic:pic` and `wps:wsp` with an `a:blipFill` in OOXML, VML
`v:oval`/`v:roundrect`/`v:shape` carrying `v:imagedata`, and Escher in an OLE2 `.doc`:

| channel | shapes | documents |
|---|--:|--:|
| OOXML non-`rect` geometry on a picture-bearing shape | **13** | **4** of 272 `docx` |
| VML `v:imagedata` in a non-`rect` element | 64 | 33 |
| Escher `pib` on a non-rectangle shape type in a `.doc` | **0** | 0 of 66 |

Only the OOXML channel can fire: `PageFrame.Preset` is set in `DocxFrames` alone, and the VML front
end sets `FillOutline` only for a fontwork warp, which carries text rather than a picture.
**Measured rather than argued** — `self-vrt.txt` renders all 35 documents in that census with the
binary before the change and the binary after, and compares the PDFs byte for byte: **exactly 4
differ, and they are the four in the table above.** The 31 VML documents are unchanged.

### And the census round 124 asked for

`nested-group-census.py`, over the same 272 `docx`: **173 outermost groups and 496 nested ones;
40 documents hold a nested group; 132 nested groups across 26 documents state a child scale off
the identity by more than 2 per cent.** That is the class "the same bug latent in fifty" would have
lived in, and it is 26 — but the bug is not in it. The two storyboard templates sit at 0.098 and
0.221 on that table, well inside the pack.

### Tests

`FrameShapedPictureTests` (seat **O80** in the register), five assertions over the three new fixtures: the clip exists, it carries
a cubic (so it is not the bounding box), it spans the picture's own 288 × 216 pt rectangle, the
bitmap still fills the frame, a crop and an outline compose, and a `rect` picture takes **no** clip
at all. **Three of the five fail at the base**; the two that pass are the controls.
`RecordingDrawingSink` now records the clip *paths* as well as their count — the count alone cannot
tell a rectangular clip from a shaped one.

---

## 2. Ten pages of the wrong paper: the break is found, and one of the two documents is a 26.2 defect

### The break, in both documents

Both runs reproduce round 124's exactly (`faa-orientation-runs.tsv`). The displacement begins at an
**empty paragraph whose only content is `<w:br w:type="page"/>`** — body index **1077** in
`24-25_FAA_Holdover_Tables.docx` (a `Caption` paragraph) and **1226** in
`FAA 2025-26 Holdover Tables.docx`. `w:br type="page"` splits the paragraph: the half before the
break stays on the current page, the half after carries the page break. When the half *before* the
break does not fit at the foot of the preceding page it starts the next page instead, and the break
then pushes everything to the page after — leaving a page with nothing on it but the running head
and foot.

**Both sides implement that rule, and the evidence is that each emits such a page in one of the two
documents.** 26.2.4.2's `24-25` page 73 carries only `FAA Holdover Time Guidelines Winter 2024-2025
· Original Issue · Page 73 of 81 · August 6, 2024` and one header rule; our `FAA 2025-26` page 83
carries only the equivalent. So it is **not** "one break decision that can err either way" — it is
one *fit* decision, and what differs is how much room is left at the foot of the page:

| | text area ends | last body ink | room | the empty half |
|---|--:|--:|--:|---|
| `24-25` p72, ours | ~573.3 | 534.0 | **39.3** | fits — no blank page |
| `24-25` p72, 26.2.4.2 | ~573.3 | 546.3 | **27.0** | does not fit — blank page 73 |
| `2025-26` p82, ours | ~573.3 | 546.7 | **26.6** | does not fit — blank page 83 |
| `2025-26` p82, 26.2.4.2 | ~573.3 | 545.2 | **28.1** | fits — no blank page |

A point and a half decides ten pages of paper orientation.

### SEAT L4 — an established 26.2 defect: a `TOC` field's `\t` switch discards the direct `w:pPr` of every paragraph in the named styles

Removing the `\t "…"` template from `24-25`'s TOC field and re-rendering **both** sides makes the
reference agree with us on orientation for pages 1–142, where before ten were flipped
(`faa-orientation-runs.tsv`, rows 7-8). So `24-25`'s ten pages are entirely the reference's.

Isolated to a two-paragraph document (`mk-heading-gap.py`, `heading-gap.tsv`). A `Heading3` style
with `w:spacing w:after="120"`, a paragraph using it with a direct `<w:spacing w:after="0"/>`, and
a note paragraph after it. The gap between the two, in points:

| probe | what it varies | ours | 26.2.4.2 |
|---|---|--:|--:|
| `gapA` | as the FAA file states it, **no TOC field** | 0.34 | **0.35** |
| `gapB` | the direct override removed, so the style's 120 applies | 6.34 | 6.35 |
| `gapH` | `gapA` **+ `TOC \h \z \t "Heading 2,1,Heading 3,2"`** | 0.34 | **6.35** |
| `gapI` | `gapA` + `TOC \o "1-3" \h \z` | 0.34 | 0.35 |
| `gapJ` | `gapA` + `TOC \h \z \t "Heading 2,1"` — the style not named | 0.34 | 0.35 |

One switch, one variable. And it is not only the spacing: with the same TOC field present,

- `gapK` — a direct `w:jc="left"` on the heading: we left-align it at x 57.55, 26.2.4.2 keeps the
  style's centring at x 74.80;
- `gapL` — a direct `w:spacing w:before="360"`: we put 18 pt above it, 26.2.4.2 puts none;
- `gapM` — a direct `w:spacing w:after="240"`: we give 12.34 pt, 26.2.4.2 gives 6.35, the style's.

**The whole direct `w:pPr` is discarded and only the style survives.** ECMA-376 Part 1 §17.7.2 puts
direct paragraph formatting last in the precedence chain — after docDefaults, the table style, the
numbering and the paragraph style — so direct formatting wins, and Word honours it. We are right.

Bisected on the real document as well (`toc-bisect.py`): cutting the body at index 24 — the
paragraph carrying `TOC \h \z \t "Heading 2,1,Heading 3,2"` — reproduces it, and cutting at 28 does
not.

**The source leg is not identified and this write-up does not claim one.** The `\t` handling in
`sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/DomainMapper_Impl.cxx`:7663-7710 only builds a level→style map,
fills `LevelParagraphStyles` and sets `CreateFromLevelParagraphStyles`; nothing there touches
paragraph attributes, so the loss happens downstream of it and I could not find where. The arm
stands on 26.2.4.2's own output, which is the leg that measures the actual reference.

**Reach** (`toc-template-census.py`, 272 `docx`):

| | documents |
|---|--:|
| carrying any `TOC` field | **50** |
| carrying a `TOC … \t "…"` template | **19** |
| of those, holding at least one paragraph whose direct `w:pPr` 26.2.4.2 discards | **7** |

and those seven hold **134 such paragraphs** — 87 in `SPA-11_mcar_part-11_v2.9.docx`, 18 in
`OM template for non-complex NCC operators_August 2016.docx`, 9 in `24-25_FAA_Holdover_Tables.docx`,
9 in `hdss-bulletin-issue-285-25-june-2025.docx`, 8 in `FAA 2025-26 Holdover Tables.docx`, 2 in
`SPA-06_mcar_part-6_and_IS_v2.9.docx` and 1 in `report-template.docx`. The base rate is the other
31 TOC-bearing documents, which `gapI`/`gapJ` show do not fire.

**The cost of declining it** is stated rather than waved at: the ten wrong-orientation pages of
`24-25_FAA_Holdover_Tables.docx` stay wrong against the reference, every page of that document from
73 on is displaced by one when paired by index, and no gate column sees any of it — the document
matches on page count (155/155) and on glyphs. Reproducing it would mean deliberately throwing away
direct paragraph formatting that Word applies, on 134 paragraphs of 7 documents, to make two of them
paginate like a defect.

### SEAT O78 — `FAA 2025-26 Holdover Tables.docx` is **not** the TOC defect

Removing the `\t` template from `2025-26` and re-rendering both sides changes **nothing**: the
reference's runs are identical to the authored ones (`faa-orientation-runs.tsv`, rows 5-6). Its ten
pages come from the 1.5 pt in the table above — our last table chunk on page 82 ends 1.5 pt lower
than the reference's, and that is the whole of the margin. The residue is a table-height difference
of a few tenths of a point per row, which is not attributed here.

**O78 measurement.** `FAA 2025-26 Holdover Tables.docx`, page 82: our last body ink at 546.7 pt
against the reference's 545.2 on a text area ending at ~573.3, so 26.6 pt of room against 28.1 —
below the height of the empty half of the `<w:br w:type="page"/>` paragraph at body index 1226, and
therefore 10 pages of landscape paper where the reference prints portrait. Reach as measured: **1 of
329 words documents** carries this exact knife-edge; the general class — a table chunk ending within
2 pt of the foot of the page, ahead of an explicit page break — is not censused.

---

## 3. REFUTED — two adjacent inline objects are split across two lines, and always were

Round 124 seated O75 on a reading of the tables: `U+0001` is UAX #14 `Line_Break=CM`, LB9 forbids a
break **before** a combining mark, so two adjacent inline-object anchors have no break opportunity
between them and the second object can never leave the first's line. The reading of the tables is
correct. `LineBreaker.FindBreakOpportunities` on two adjacent anchors does return only the
end-of-text break, and it is LB9 that removes the one between them — and the rule reads the
*original* class, not the resolved one, so it also survives any LB1 substitution.

**It does not govern.** Two probes, each a single paragraph of two inline pictures:

| probe | picture widths | measure | ours | 26.2.4.2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/corpus/features/inline-object-pair.docx` | 4.5 in, 4.5 in | 6.5 in | y 72.0–153.0 and 153.0–234.0 | the same two rectangles |
| `pairprobe-pair-wide` (the witness's own geometry) | 6.5 in, 6.5 in | 6.5 in | y 72.0–258.6 and 258.6–471.0 | 71.9–258.5 and 258.6–471.0 |

Both split, on both sides, and identically — **before** the change as well as after, so nothing in
this round produced it. A run holding nothing but anchors never reaches the breaker as a pair: it
goes through `MeasuredParagraph`'s own path, where an inline object widens every prefix past its
boundary and is pushed to the next line when anything precedes it — the rule `CLAUDE.md` already
records from the PES cover-art fix.

A change resolving the anchor to `LineBreakClass.CB` (the class of `U+FFFC`, which LB20 allows a
break on both sides of) was written, built and measured: it makes the breaker offer the break, and
it moves **nothing** — not the witness, not either probe. It was reverted rather than kept, because
a change to a shared layer with no measured effect is not one this project takes. The control is in
the suite instead: `InlineObjectPairTests`, which pins the split and carries the refutation.

### SEAT O79 — the witness is the WW8 reader, not the line breaker

`RMI_Document_Repository_Public-Reprts_GettingOffOil.doc` page 2 still draws its two as-char
pictures on one baseline:

| | upper picture | lower picture |
|---|---|---|
| 26.2.4.2 | y 99.60–358.35 | y 338.25–632.70 |
| this tree | y 115.10–373.95 | y 79.40–373.95 |

Ours share a bottom edge to the hundredth of a point and overlap almost completely, which reads
exactly like a missing picture. Their heights are right (258.85 and 294.55). Reach, from round
124's own `baseline-pair-census.py`: **1 of 329 words documents, against a base rate of 0** in the
reference. The mechanism is in the WW8 reader's handling of as-char frames, not in `Paperless.Text`.

---

## 4. What was measured and discarded

- **The heading gap is not a property of the paragraph.** Five variants of the real `Heading3`
  paragraph — its `w:br`, its 12 pt run among 13 pt runs, its paragraph-mark `rPr`, the note's
  `widowControl`, an `after="0"` written with `line`/`lineRule` — all give 0.34/0.35 on both sides
  (`heading-gap.tsv`, `gapC`-`gapG`). Cutting the same two paragraphs out of the real document with
  all of its parts intact gives 0.33/0.34 as well. Only the document's TOC field changes it.
- **The nested-group transform of `075` and `079` is right**, which is the refutation §0 records;
  the clip rectangles agree with 26.2.4.2's own image placements to 0.09 pt.
- **`custGeom` on a picture has nil corpus reach**: 0 of 947.
- **Escher pictures in non-rectangular shapes have nil corpus reach**: 0 across the 66 `.doc`.

The fidelity project's ten failures are the set `CLAUDE.md` records as left failing on purpose: the
eight advance-family assertions — `AListLabelsTabAdvancesToLibreOfficesStop` and
`EveryLineIsDrawnWhereLibreOfficeDrawsIt` over `list-label-overrun.*` and `paginated.*`, which compare
a position reconstructed inside one reference text object against a channel quantised to whole
thousandths of an em — plus `SheetDrawingComparisonTests` on `sheet-rich-text.xlsx` and
`justify-shrink-2013.docx`. **None involves a picture or the words drawing path, and none is new.**
0 skipped on every project, so no part of the suite covered nothing.

python3 shaped-picture-census.py  /home/user/sample-files/words    > shaped-picture.tsv
python3 nested-group-census.py    /home/user/sample-files/words    > nested-group.tsv
python3 toc-template-census.py    /home/user/sample-files          > toc-template.tsv
python3 mk-shaped-picture.py <picture-crop.docx> <outdir>
python3 mk-heading-gap.py    <outdir>
python3 toc-bisect.py <lo> <hi> <name>     # cut the FAA body to body[lo..hi] + section 17's sectPr
```

## 7. The banked data

| file | what |
|---|---|
| `pic-preset.tsv` | every corpus document with a `pic:pic` in a non-`rect` geometry |
| `shaped-picture.tsv` | the same across all four words channels, OOXML / VML / Escher |
| `nested-group.tsv` | every `docx` holding a nested group, with its worst child scale |
| `toc-template.tsv` | every `docx` with a `TOC` field, and what its `\t` template costs |
| `heading-gap.tsv` | the ten heading-gap probes, ours against 26.2.4.2 |
| `faa-orientation-runs.tsv` | both FAA documents' orientation runs, both sides, as authored and with the TOC template removed |
| `self-vrt.txt` | the 35-document before/after byte comparison behind item 1's reach |
