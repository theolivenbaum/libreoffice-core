# Confinement sweep for round 149: render OUR half of the whole 947-document corpus and of the 337
# converted `.odt` twice -- once at the round's base and once with the fix -- and diff.
#
# `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` is pinned, because a document printing a date draws different ink on a
# different second and an unpinned sweep reports EVERYTHING moving (dotnet/CLAUDE.md records a round
# that read 176 of 176 that way). One output directory per DOCUMENT, never per worker slot.
# The document list is MANIFEST.tsv's own paths, never a `find` total: the case-insensitive mount
# materialises alias entries when a tool resolves a document, so a `find` count drifts upwards on
# its own.
