# Mutation pin for O101's WW8 and RTF thirds. Six arms: the value, the adjacent-run MERGE and the
# uniform-paragraph varies-predicate, for each reader. The merge arm is the one a one-line probe
# cannot see -- WW8 builds its runs a character at a time, so a scaled stretch missing from the
# comparison is absorbed into the unscaled run beside it before the shortcut is ever asked.
#
# Restores with `cp` + `touch`, never `mv` and never `git checkout` alone: either leaves the source
# older than the assembly and MSBuild then SKIPS the project while reporting `0 Error(s)`. Round 150
# lost two "base" builds to exactly that.
