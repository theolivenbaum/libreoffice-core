"""The ceiling for "a list label raises the line-spacing base height".

    label-spacing-census.py <corpus-root> [glob]

Round 46's `list-label-population.py` counted DOCX that resolve some paragraph to
proportional spacing above 100% *and* carry a numbering level stating its own `w:sz`, and
got 51 of 134. That was written for the rule round 46 believed — that a label behaves like
an as-character picture. The probes in this directory refute that: the label **does** raise
the base, so the population is every paragraph whose label is *taller than its item*, and a
label is taller for reasons `w:sz` cannot see.

So this prints two bands rather than one:

    outer   spacing > 100% anywhere in the chain, and the body numbers some paragraph.
            This is the true upper bound: any numbered paragraph can have a taller label,
            because a level in Symbol or Wingdings at the *same* point size still has a
            different line box from the item's Latin face.
    inner   the same, restricted to a level that states its own `w:sz`. Round 46's count,
            reproduced here so the two are read side by side.

**What neither can see**, said before the numbers:

- **the 66 `.doc`**, whose levels live in the WW8 `LSTF`/`LVLF` structures. The fix is in
  `Paperless.Text` and both readers build the same `PageLabel`, so the binary half is
  reachable and invisible to this script. Round 45 had to go through LibreOffice's own flat
  ODF export to see that half at all.
- **whether the label is really taller.** That needs the level's face and the item's
  resolved face and size, both through their style chains, and then the two line boxes.
- **whether a taller label on a spaced line moves any break.** A first line 2 pt taller
  moves a page break only when the page was within 2 pt of full.

Quote it as a ceiling, and measure the reach by rendering.
