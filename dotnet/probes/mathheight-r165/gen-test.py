/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The reference does not lay an OMML formula out as text: it imports the subtree into a StarMath
/// object anchored as-character, so the line takes the <em>object's</em> height. That height is
/// readable without a rasteriser -- <c>soffice --convert-to fodt</c> prints it as the
/// <c>draw:frame</c>'s <c>svg:height</c> -- and the expected value on every arm here is that
/// attribute, converted to points, from a fixture built out of the real document's own parts so
/// that it inherits the same OOXML compatibility defaults.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why a ladder rather than one assertion.</strong> The heights compose: a fraction is its
/// numerator plus its denominator plus a rule, a script is clamped against a line 40 % of the way
/// up the base. One number for a whole formula says a walk is wrong and not which construct broke,
/// and the constructs are what a later round will change. The fixtures, the sweep and the
/// per-construct table are in <c>probes/mathheight-r165/</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The tolerance is a quarter of a point and it is not slack.</strong> StarMath computes in
/// whole hundredths of a millimetre -- 0.028 pt -- with integer division at every level, so a
/// four-deep construct carries a few units of the reference's own rounding; the two nested-radical
/// arms carry more, because the sign's glyph box is approximated by the height <c>AdaptToY</c> asks
/// for rather than measured from OpenSymbol. Nothing here is fitted: the leaf height and ascent are
/// two measured constants and every other number is <c>SmFormat</c>'s own default.
