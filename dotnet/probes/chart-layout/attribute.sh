# Decide whether a corpus document's verdict moved because of *this* round.
#
# `sweep.py` scores against the gate at `2f4709c08`, and this round's base is `faadf7dda` — many
# commits later — so a moved verdict may belong to anything landed between them. This builds a
# binary with only this round's five files returned to their committed base contents, renders the
# named documents with it, and prints the gate columns both ways.
#
# The five files are copied aside and restored with `cp` followed by `touch`, never `mv`: a
# restored file with an older mtime than the assembly makes MSBuild skip the project and the
# "reverted" binary still carries the change. See dotnet/CLAUDE.md.
