"""How much of a growing frame's text never reaches the page.

`paperless extract` walks the content tree and never lays anything out, so it reports what a
document holds; the render reports what was drawn.  A frame taller than the room left on its
page draws its tail outside the sheet, where `pdftotext` cannot see it — so
render << extract is the signature of a frame that the reference splits and we do not.
