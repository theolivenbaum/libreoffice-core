# slides-r52 — results

Environment: LibreOffice **26.2.4.2 620(Build:2)**, `fc-match "DejaVu Sans"` → `DejaVuSans.ttf`,
`fc-match Calibri` → `Carlito-Regular.ttf`, base `a21e64f6d7e`, `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1700000000`,
`TZ=UTC`. Read `prediction.md` beside this file first; it was committed before anything was
rendered post-change.

## Baseline, and it reproduced exactly

Whole-track sweep, all 35 slides batches, reconciled document by document against `MANIFEST.tsv`
on a **case-folded** identity: **302 of 302 agree, 0 disagreements — 199 of 302 passing.**
The sweep's own `TOTAL` reads 311; that is the case-insensitive mount's 9 alias spellings.

A second, independent confirmation of the baseline arrived late and is worth recording, because it
is the alias trap firing exactly as the brief said it would. The **before** leg of this round's
ink A/B — a rendering of the whole track from a binary rebuilt at the base commit — totals
`ABS-INK 1413.17 / SIGNED 1038.16 / MAJOR 507` **over the script's own 311 rows**, and
**1394.04 / 1026.62 / 494 over `MANIFEST.tsv`'s 302 paths.** Round 51 reported
**1394.03 / 1026.61 / 494**. The manifest-scored figure reproduces the predecessor to the digit;
the sweep's own `TOTAL` does not, and the whole 19-unit discrepancy is nine documents counted
twice. *Score against the manifest, never a sweep's `TOTAL`.*

## Measured against the prediction

| | predicted | measured |
|---|---|---|
| **verdict movement** | −2 to +4, **most likely 0** | **0** — 199 → 199, and `MANIFEST` agrees on all 302 |
| page counts | 0 of 302 | **0 of 302** |
| word counts | "both directions, net gain" | **8 documents moved, 3 nearer the reference and 5 further** |
| renderings moved | "well under 241 candidates" | **101 of 302** — 73 improved, 28 worsened |
| `abs_ink` | not predicted | **1394.04 → 1238.64**, −155.40 (−11.1%) |
| signed ink | not predicted | 1026.62 → **913.80** |
| major pages | not predicted | 494 → **434** |
| tests | re-measure four theories | four theories re-measured, **14 expectations moved** |

For scale: round 50 moved `abs_ink` by −10.34 and round 51 by −15.33. This one moves it by
**−155.40**, and it does it with zero verdict movement — which is the gate's blind spot stated as
a number rather than as a complaint.

## Target 1 is empty, and the instrument that says so passes a known-answer check

Round 51's first item was the wrap approximation in `PptSlideLayout.Autofits`, on a census
finding **36 of 51 `.ppt` documents** with a `wrapNone`-and-not-`fFitShapeToText` OPT table. It
said 36 was an upper bound until each OPT table was tied to its `TextHeaderAtom` kind.

Tied (`ppt-autofit-census.py`):

| | |
|---|---:|
| `.ppt` documents | 51 |
| text-bearing shapes | 6989 |
| of Body/HalfBody/QuarterBody kind | 1402 |
| … `fFitShapeToText` (both suppress autofit) | 143 |
| … wrapping (both autofit) | 1234 |
| … **`wrapNone`, so we suppress autofit** | **25, all in `Fundamentals_Module_1_basics.ppt`** |
| … of those, carrying an `OEPlaceholderAtom` | **0** |

**Known-answer control**: the same walker restricted to r51's measurement — OPT tables alone,
whole stream — returns **36 documents**, r51's figure exactly. The instrument agrees with the
independent one on the common quantity, so the collapse is the Body-kind restriction and not a
different parser.

The placeholder column is the other half, and it is what makes the answer zero rather than one.
`svdfppt.cxx` reaches `bAutoGrowWidth = !bWordWrap` only through
`dynamic_cast<SdrObjCustomShape*>(pRet) && eTextKind == Rectangle`, and **line 846 sets
`pRet = nullptr` for any shape carrying an `OEPlaceholderAtom`**. So the wrap term can fire only
on a shape with no placeholder atom — which all 25 are. On every one of them LibreOffice
suppresses autofit exactly as we do.

**The comment standing beside `Autofits` was right and round 51's refutation of it was measuring
the wrong population.** It reaches zero documents and no code changed there.

## What the round shipped instead, and it is target 2 arriving underneath target 1

`SlideAutofit` was an explicit port of **24.2.7.2**'s bisection. Its own remarks said so, said that
25.2 had replaced the search with a walk down `constScaleLevels`, and ended
*"check which version wrote the reference before porting anything out of this tree."* The
installed reference has been **26.2.4.2** for many rounds. Nobody checked.

### The measurement: 36 one-slide decks, one variable

A single 40 pt paragraph in a 360 pt-wide `a:normAutofit` box, box height 60…480 pt, **each height
in its own file**, `/Tf` and baseline pitch read out of both content streams
(`make-fit-probe.py`, `research/probes/slides-r15/read-autofit.py`).

The reference's answers, as the box shrinks:

| box pt | reference | `constScaleLevels` row |
|---|---|---|
| 480…336 | 40 pt / spacing 1.00 | *unscaled — no overflow* |
| 324…312 | 40 / **0.90** | `{1.000, 0.900}` |
| 300…288 | 37 / 0.90 | `{0.925, 0.900}` |
| 276…228 | 34 / **0.90** | `{0.850, 0.900}` |
| 216…204 | 34 / **0.80** | `{0.850, 0.800}` |
| 192…180 | 31 / 0.80 | `{0.775, 0.800}` |
| 168…144 | 28 / 0.80 | `{0.700, 0.800}` |
| 132…120 | 25 / 0.80 | `{0.625, 0.800}` |
| 108…96 | 22 / 0.80 | `{0.550, 0.800}` |
| 84 | 19 / 0.80 | `{0.475, 0.800}` |
| 72…60 | 16 / 0.80 | `{0.400, 0.800}` |

**Every row of the table, in order, with both 0.850 rows present and nothing off the table.** Our
bisection answered 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,
38, 39, 40 — essentially every whole point — and agreed with the reference on **13 of 36** boxes.

**The two documents this round was briefed to chase are the two ends of that one table.** Height
168 is the case a blind reviewer named unprompted as *"font scale applied without the matching
spacing reduction"*: both sides draw **28 pt** and the reference's baseline pitch is **26.90**
against our **33.62**. It is not a missing multiplier — `ScaledSpace` has scaled paragraph space
since round 20 — it is that our search chose the pair `(0.700, 1.000)` where the table has no such
row.

Three further conditions, each measured on authored decks rather than read out of the tree:

1. **No slack.** 24.2's `aCurrentTextBoxSize.extendBy(0, -50)` is gone. Stepping 330…340 pt at
   1 pt, the reference stops scaling at **exactly 336** and scales at 335; 1.417 pt of slack would
   have put the boundary at 334.
2. **The stated scale is still thrown away.** `fontScale="62500"`, `lnSpcReduction="20000"`, and
   both together, in a box far too tall to shrink: **40 pt at full spacing in all three.**
   `SlideAutofit`'s existing note survives the version move. (The mechanism is visible in
   `textbodypropertiescontext.cxx`:241-243 — `lnSpcReduction` defaults to `100000` and the
   property is set to `1.0 - 1.0 = 0.0`, which fails `setupAutoFitText`'s `fSpacingScale > 0.0`
   guard — but the `fontScale`+`lnSpcReduction` case should have passed that guard and did not, so
   the measurement is what is being relied on here, not the reading.)
3. **The rounding is `std::round` in the hundredth-of-a-millimetre domain and the order of the
   arithmetic decides two cases.** At a stated 30 pt the reference draws **25** at level 0.850
   (25.5 rounding *down*) and **17** at level 0.550 (16.5 rounding *up*). Both fall out of
   `roundToNearestPt(roundToNearestPt(deviceRealised) × level)` in doubles — 899.5833…→25.49999996
   and 582.0833…→16.50000000 — and neither falls out of multiplying in points, which gives 26
   and 17.

### Known-answer checks after the change

| probe | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| 36 solo decks at a stated 40 pt, size **and** pitch | 13 of 36 | **36 of 36** |
| 21 solo decks at a stated 30 pt (the half-point levels) | not run | **21 of 21** |
| 9 + 3 decks reproducing the unit tests' fixture | — | **12 of 12** |
| `tests/corpus/features/slide-autofit-grid.pptx`, all 23 slides | — | **23 of 23**, ≤0.0007 pt |

## Refutations, including two of my own claims

### 1. Round 51's target 1 — above. Reaches zero documents.

### 2. My own prediction item 6 was wrong, and my own measurement is what killed it

I wrote that *"the reference's shared-outliner state leak is real and I am not reproducing it"*,
on the evidence that the same 480 pt box answered spacing 1.00 as a solo slide and 0.90 as page 71
of a 71-slide deck.

**There is no leak.** The 0.90 reading was an `awk` filter of mine that collapsed rows on the
`/Tf` column alone, so the transition from `{1.000, 0.900}` to unscaled at page 47 was invisible
and page 71 inherited page 42's line in the output. Re-read collapsing on *both* columns, the
71-slide deck's transition sits at height **336** — the same boundary the 36 solo decks give, to
the point. A two-slide deck rendered in both orders gives the tall box 40/1.00 either way.

So the multi-slide fixture is sound, the solo decks are sound, and they agree. **An instrument
that aggregates on one column cannot see a change in another, and I built the claim on it.**

### 3. "The reference draws fractional em sizes there" does not explain the regressions

Eight documents lost `/Tf` agreement (§ below). All eight are `.ppt`, and on several the reference
draws sizes that are *not* whole points — `Lepore.ppt` p2 draws **20.0 ×11 and 20.4 ×6 on one
page**, and 20.4 is 24 × 0.850 exactly, unrounded. That is a fit path with
`setRoundFontSizeToPt` off, so not `setupAutoFitText`. A tempting explanation.

**Run over the documents that improved, it dies** (§ 7 of HANDOVER, and this is its fifth
instrument): 45 of the 77 improved documents also carry >5% fractional reference sizes, and
`2014BSA_Sunday_Killion.pptx` is 81% fractional and **improved**. Mean share 0.2736 among the
worsened against 0.1015 among the improved — a tendency, not a classifier. The regressions stay
unexplained, and § "left open" says what to measure instead.

## Verdict movement: none, in either direction

199 → 199. `MANIFEST.tsv` agrees on all 302 documents in both sweeps, so no document changed
verdict and none needs re-filing. Page counts moved on **0 of 302**.

Eight word counts moved, all inside the band, and they are **not** all improvements:

| Δ | document | ours/ref before → after | |
|---:|---|---|---|
| +8 | `Framing Europe.ppt` | 2237/2237 → 2245/2237 | **was exact, now +8** |
| +4 | `Structural Testing.pptx` | 4362/4340 → 4366/4340 | further |
| +2 | `RRM-training-syllabus-Chapter-3…ppt` | 2475/2576 → 2477/2576 | nearer |
| −2 | `pods05.ppt` | 1882/1884 → 1880/1884 | further |
| −2 | `1200-Assigning-Club-officers.pptx` | 165/165 → 163/165 | **was exact, now −2** |
| +1 | `8.16_AOD_FINAL_Provider_Training…ppt` | 4310/4311 → 4311/4311 | **now exact** |
| +1 | `Intersil_Italy_CAN_Bus…pptx` | 3454/3435 → 3455/3435 | further |
| −1 | `Architecture.ppt` | 846/845 → 845/845 | **now exact** |

Three nearer, five further, none near its band edge. Our own extracted character multiset moved on
**19 of 302** renderings, 15 of them by a single character — re-wrap moving a hyphen or a space.
The change is geometric and the text layer barely notices, which is why the gate cannot see it.

## Ink, per document, before → after

Scored over `MANIFEST.tsv`'s 302 paths: `abs_ink` **1394.04 → 1238.64**, signed
**1026.62 → 913.80**, major pages **494 → 434**. `|signed| ≤ unsigned` holds on both sides.
**101 documents moved, 73 improved and 28 worsened.**

| Δ abs | document | abs before → after |
|---:|---|---|
| **−14.58** | `dhs-293364.pptx` | 17.10 → 2.52 |
| **−14.09** | `ev122_jj-liew-tort-of-bribery-webinar.pptx` | 15.23 → 1.14 |
| **−13.47** | `71393_pp7.ppt` | 17.37 → 3.90 |
| **−11.95** | `chapter_4_0.pptx` | 25.43 → 13.48 |
| **−9.43** | `berlin.ppt` | 16.67 → 7.24 |
| **−9.41** | `ITE106-Chapter 4.ppt` | 28.63 → 19.22 |
| **−9.21** | `Employment-Based_I-485.ppt` | 18.99 → 9.78 |
| **−8.32** | `2015-Civil-Rights-Website-training.ppt` | 44.42 → 36.10 |
| **−5.97** | `Copy of Full deck with references Promotion of Outside Interests…pptx` | 8.54 → 2.57 |
| **−5.18** | `16 - UTM - (NASA).pptx` | 20.28 → 15.10 |
| **−4.82** | `BHCA Part II webinar #2 - 10.2020.pptx` | 6.25 → 1.43 |
| **−4.25** | `BUS-Chapter 05.ppt` | 14.26 → 10.01 |

**The regressions, stated rather than netted:**

| Δ abs | document | abs before → after |
|---:|---|---|
| **+4.69** | `Lepore.ppt` | 4.90 → 9.59 |
| **+3.35** | `gfopportunitiesforlinkagespres_2010_en.ppt` | 11.84 → 15.19 |
| **+3.16** | `FAA_Form_337.ppt` | 18.68 → 21.84 |

| **+1.21** | `joint_user_outcomes_michael_fullerton_29.06.12.ppt` | 8.12 → 9.33 |
| **+1.20** | `hofman.ppt` | 1.33 → 2.53 |
| +0.65 | `066_Free_PowerPoint_Layered_Funnel_Process_c0b380ec.pptx` | 3.30 → 3.95 |
| +0.48 | `067_Free_PowerPoint_Layered_Funnel_Process_4_Stages_4deb9647.pptx` | 2.68 → 3.16 |
| +0.44 | `009_3-Circle_Venn_PowerPoint_Diagram_2e59baa9.pptx` | 0.10 → 0.54 |

The remaining 18 are ≤ +0.40.

## The instrument that measures what the change actually controls

Round 51 recorded that a small ink rise can be the *opposite* of a regression, so ink alone cannot
adjudicate the twenty-eight above. `tf-agreement.py` scores, per page, the multiset of `/Tf` sizes
we draw against the reference's, weighted by how many show operators carry each:

| | before | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| mean per-document agreement | 0.72571 | **0.75160** |
| pages whose size multiset is **exact** | 1388 of 4515 | **1552 of 4515** |
| documents whose agreement moved | — | 85: **77 improved, 8 worsened** |

The eight that worsened are `Lepore`, `WC_Update-Aug03`, `gfopportunitiesforlinkagespres_2010_en`,
`FAA_Form_337`, `ws_prod-g-doc-Events-r-6.-ESM`, `joint_user_outcomes…`, `EG1_dsrc tech` and
`010605Vul` — **all `.ppt`, and the same documents as the ink regressions.** So on those the ink
rise agrees with the sizes and they are real regressions, not the round-51 unmasking effect. They
are named here for that reason.

## The blind readings, before and after, four fresh reviewers

Four reviewers, none of which had read this brief, could read source, documentation or `results.md`,
or run a command. Each was given one composed page and nothing else, and asked to describe each
half separately, give **direction**, say what looked identical, and name the causes the image
cannot decide between. The before/after split was not disclosed to any of them.

### `2015-Civil-Rights-Website-training__ppt` p42 — closed

- **Before**: *"the top breaks lines earlier … the top's body runs two lines longer overall — 14 vs
  12 … the top's last line crowding the page number."*
- **After**: *"all 12 lines break at exactly the same words in both halves … no line wraps earlier
  or later in either"*, and it listed left margin, right wrap boundary, intra-paragraph pitch,
  title, rule, logo and page-number position as identical.

Measured on the page rather than read: the body em was **24.009 pt against the reference's 21.997**
and is now **21.997**; baselines went **21 → 19** against the reference's 19, and all nineteen sit
within **0.5 pt** of the reference's.

**And the after-reviewer's own top-ranked observation was an instrument defect, which it caught
itself.** It reported the body block ~15–20% taller and the page number drifting with it, and
named *"anisotropic canvas scale — the two halves rasterized at the same width but different
heights"* as its first candidate, with rule-to-page-number span as the discriminator. `pdfinfo`
says both pages are 720 × 540 pt and the baselines agree within 0.5 pt, so the candidate the
reviewer put first is the correct one and the difference is in the composed image. `page-vision`
already says this — *check that "it is absent" is not a fact about the pipeline that built the
image* — and a reviewer applying it unprompted is the method working.

### `ITE106-Chapter 4__ppt` p7 — better, not closed, and it names the next target

- **Before**: ours 9 body lines to the reference's 10, ours 10–13% smaller, inter-bullet gaps
  **3.0 line-heights against 1.8**. Its proposed mechanism, unprompted: *"an autofit implementation
  that shrinks glyphs but not paragraph spacing."*
- **After**: **10 lines to 10, 2/2/3/3 both sides.** But the reference still sets the body larger,
  and the reviewer again reported our inter-bullet gaps as far wider — *"roughly 2.3 extra
  line-heights of white space, versus roughly 0.85"*.

Measured on the page:

| | ours before | ours after | reference |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| body `/Tf` | 21.005 | **21.997** | **24.009** |
| baselines | 18 | **19** | 19 |
| intra-paragraph gap | 25.20 | 23.75 | **28.80** |
| inter-paragraph gap | 72.87 | 64.96 | **50.88** |
| paragraph space above the line | 47.67 | 41.21 | **22.08** |

Our paragraph space is **1.9 times** the reference's once each side's own spacing scale is taken
off (41.21/0.8 = 51.5 against 22.08/0.9 = 24.5). That extra height is why the walk stops one row
deeper than the reference's — 0.775 where the reference takes 0.850. **The residual on this page is
inter-paragraph space in the `.ppt` reader, and the autofit table is now carrying its error rather
than causing it.**

## The property of the fix that the next round has to know

A bisection over a fine grid **absorbs a small height-measurement error**; a twelve-row table
**quantises it into a whole row**. That is the mechanism behind all eight `/Tf` regressions, and it
is not an argument against the table — the table is what the reference does, measured 36 + 21 + 12
+ 23 ways. It means the value of every remaining `.ppt` height defect has gone up: an error that
used to cost a tenth of a point now costs 7.5% of the font size.

## Instruments, including one that returned zero and is reported as such

`offpage-charstream.py` was written to reproduce r50's "30 of our renderings drew text outside the
page against the reference's 9". It returns **0 for both legs and 0 for the reference**, which is a
failed known-answer check, so **nothing is claimed from it**. The reason is structural: `pdftotext
-bbox` reports the text poppler extracts, and text outside the media box is clipped before it gets
there. Off-page text has to be counted from the content stream's pen positions, which is what r50
must have done. The script's charstream half is sound and is quoted above.

## Tests

`SlideAutofitTests` is now **43 theories and facts, 773 tests in the project** against 772.
**Fourteen expectations moved**, and every one was re-measured against 26.2.4.2 rather than
adjusted to fit:

| theory | how re-measured | moved |
|---|---|---:|
| `OneLineShrinksToTheSizeTheReferenceDraws` | 9 one-slide decks, "A" at 40 pt in a 60 pt box | 6 of 9 |
| `TwoLinesShrinkToTheSizeTheReferenceDraws` | 3 of the same | 2 of 3 |
| `AWrappingBodyLandsOnTheReferencesSizeAndSpacing` | the existing `slide-autofit-grid.pptx`, all 23 slides re-read | 6 rows replaced by 7 |
| `TheFitsSpacingScaleReachesAParagraphsOwnSpace` | heights re-chosen, expectations unchanged | 2 of 3 heights |

The wrapping theory gained a case on purpose. **120 pt and 135 pt both draw 17 pt and differ only
in the spacing beside it, 0.80 and 0.90** — the pair that exists because `constScaleLevels` holds
0.850 twice. No search over a font scale can produce two spacings at one size, so that pair fails
against every reading of the bisection and against a font-scale table without the second column.
It is the discriminating case and it is the reason the heights moved as well as the values.

`AnOverflowingBodyStopsAtAQuarterAndOverflows` and `NoBodyIsEverScaledToNothing` **did not move**:
their expectations were already read off a banked 26.2.4.2 rendering of `NWD-GLA…`, and 0.250/0.800
is the table's last row, so the walk subsumes the old clamp rather than contradicting it. That is a
drift guard that was pointing at the right binary all along.

**Verification by reintroduction was not applicable to this change and is stated rather than
implied.** The mutation that matters — putting the bisection back — is the diff itself, and it was
measured directly on 36 + 21 solo decks and on the 23-slide fixture: 13 of 36 against 36 of 36.
The `TheFitsSpacingScaleReachesAParagraphsOwnSpace` heights are chosen so one lands on each of the
three spacing scales, which is what makes a spacing-scale regression detectable there; a box at
full spacing alone would pass under either reading.

Ten non-Fidelity projects: Core 337, Containers 109, Text 596, Vector 295,
Rendering 150 (+1 skipped, `PdfFontTests.ACffFlavouredFaceIsNotClaimedToBeTrueType`, skipped at
baseline too), Markup 259, OpenDocument 125, WordProcessing 1061, Spreadsheets 886,
**Presentations 773** — **4591 passed, 0 failed, 1 skipped**, against the briefed
4590/0/1: **+1**, which is the extra theory case.

`cd dotnet && dotnet build -v q -nologo` → **0 warnings, 0 errors**.

## Shared layers: none, and it is a two-file diff

`dotnet/src/Paperless.Presentations/Layout/SlideAutofit.cs` and its test file, plus four probe
scripts and these two documents. Nothing in `Core`, `Containers`, `Text`, `Vector`, `Rendering`,
`Markup` or `Paperless.Ooxml`; `DocxPictures.cs`, `XlsxDrawings.cs` and the DrawingML fill path are
untouched. `Scaling` is a private nested type of `SlideTextLayout` and `Solve` is called from
nowhere outside `Paperless.Presentations`. **No cross-track sweep is owed.** The WordProcessing and
Spreadsheets suites were run anyway and are green.

`MANIFEST.tsv` needs **no** change: zero verdicts moved, no document changed kind, and it lives in
the corpus repo, which was not touched.

## Left open, in the order the next round should take them

1. **Inter-paragraph space in the `.ppt` reader.** Measured on `ITE106-Chapter 4.ppt` p7: our
   paragraph space is **1.9×** the reference's with each side's spacing scale removed (41.21/0.8
   against 22.08/0.9), and that is what pushes the fit one row deeper than the reference's. Two
   blind reviewers on that page, one before the change and one after, both put the inter-bullet
   gap at the top of their list, and the earlier one named the mechanism. It is now *also* the
   most likely driver of the eight `/Tf` regressions, all of which are `.ppt`. Start there and
   re-run `tf-agreement.py` — it is the instrument that can see it and the gate cannot.
2. **The reference has a second fit mode on `.ppt` that does not round to whole points.**
   `Lepore.ppt` p2: the reference draws **20.0 ×11 and 20.4 ×6 on one page**, and 20.4 is
   24 × 0.850 exactly. `setRoundFontSizeToPt` is on only inside `setupAutoFitText`, so those
   shapes are not going through it, yet they are on a `constScaleLevels` font scale. Find which
   `SdrFitToSizeType` they take. Seven of the eight regressed documents carry such sizes — but the
   control above says that is not a classifier, so measure it, do not assume it.
3. **`8_P-Pavese_AIRBUS…pptx`'s missing orange table backgrounds** — untouched this round and still
   the third item. Its `a:tblPr` does name a style id and the reference draws 30 `#FBECE7` +
   25 `#F8D7CD` fills; find out whether that id resolves against the 74 built-in table styles
   ported from `predefined-table-styles.cxx`. Its `abs_ink` is **47.76**, the second largest on the
   track. An earlier brief dismissed this and was wrong; the user was right.
4. **`pitchFamily`'s family nibble** — still a decision for the user, not a patch. Nothing has
   changed since r50 measured it.
5. `038_Competitive_Advantage_Card` and `035_Chemistry_Column_PowerPoint_Chart` — still the only
   two genuine content differences in the old `text` pool, both in chart labels.

## A note for whoever writes the next brief

The line in `SlideAutofit`'s remarks that said *"this is a port of 24.2 and the reference is now
26.2.4.2, check which version wrote the reference before porting anything out of this tree"* had
been sitting in the file, correct and unread, for the whole time the container has been on
26.2.4.2. It cost the largest single ink movement this track has recorded. **`grep -rn "24\.2" dotnet/src`
is a one-line audit and it has not been run.**
