# Ink at two binaries against the banked 26.2.4.2 reference, for every document of the list.
# Ink is `|ink|%` from pdf-image-diff.py summed unsigned over the document's pages and MAJOR is
# that script's own verdict; a document whose page counts differ is reported by that script as no
# pages at all, and its 0.00 is an absence of measurement rather than a score. Each render is
# deleted as soon as it is scored: a 186-page workbook is a large fraction of what is free here,
# and on a full disk writes fail while deletes still succeed, so a sweep that runs out leaves
# truncated PDFs scoring as real differences.
