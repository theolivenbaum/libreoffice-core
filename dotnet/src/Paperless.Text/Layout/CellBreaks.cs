/// wider than the room left on the line it is not moved down and it is not offered to the break
/// iterator: <c>ImpEditEngine::CreateLines</c>' <c>EE_FEATURE_FIELD</c> branch walks the field's
/// own text with <c>XBreakIterator::nextCharacters(…, CharacterIteratorMode::SKIPCELL, …)</c> and
/// records a break wherever the next <em>cell</em> would overflow
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx</c>:1101-1200). A cell is a grapheme cluster, so on
/// Latin text that is an opportunity at every character.

/// <para>
/// That is the whole of <em>“the reference breaks a long URL mid-token where we break only at
/// <c>-</c> and <c>/</c>”</em>: it is neither a URL rule nor a hyphenation rule, it is what a
/// field does — and a <c>text:a</c> in a draw shape's text <em>is</em> a field, because
/// <c>txtparai.cxx</c>:1352-1370 picks <c>XMLUrlFieldImportContext</c> whenever the cursor has no
/// <c>HyperLinkURL</c> property, which is every Draw and Impress text.

/// that fits is still placed whole and a field that does not is filled to the character rather
/// than pushed onto the next line. And the solidus glue — see
/// <c>LineFiller.GluedAcrossSolidus</c> — must not fire on a break inside one, because that rule
/// belongs to <c>BreakIterator_Unicode::getLineBreak</c> and a field never asks it anything.
