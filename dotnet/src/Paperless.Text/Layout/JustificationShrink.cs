/// LibreOffice states it in as many words where it turns the behaviour on —

/// The rule is applied in <c>SwTextPortion::Format_</c>
/// (<c>sw/source/core/text/portxt.cxx:545</c>): having guessed a break the ordinary way, a full
/// justified line is guessed again with its blanks at a <em>minimum word spacing</em>, and the longer
/// guess taken. For a file that says nothing more than <c>compatibilityMode</c> — every Word 2013 file,
/// which is what <c>bOldInterop</c> names there — that minimum is
/// <see cref="MinimumBlankProportion">75%</see>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Stated as an allowance rather than as a second break attempt, because a greedy filler already walks
/// the break opportunities in order: a candidate line fits when its natural width is within its room plus
/// <see cref="AllowanceFor"/>, which is exactly "every blank on it can be squeezed to 75% and it then
/// fits". That formulation is self-consistent — the line finally chosen satisfies the constraint it was
/// measured against — where the reference's is an estimate, since it has to guess the blank count of a
/// line it has not broken yet and adds one for the space the new word brings with it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on <c>BID_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT_FORM_FOR_A320.docx</c>, whose first justified line holds sixteen
/// words summing to 417.63 pt in a 468.0 pt column: we set fifteen gaps at 3.358 pt and the reference
/// seventeen words with sixteen gaps at 1.894 pt, against a natural Carlito space of 2.26 pt. That is a
/// blank at 83.8% of its natural width — inside the 75% floor, and the reason the reference fits a word
/// we do not.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Taking the maximum shrink is 24.2.7.2's rule and 26.2.4.2 weighs it instead.</b> The 75% floor
/// still says how far a blank <em>may</em> be squeezed; what changed is that reaching the floor no
/// longer decides the break. Having guessed at the minimum spacing, `portxt.cxx`:769-805 compares the
/// blanks the longer line would squeeze against the blanks the shorter line would stretch, weighting
/// the stretch by <see cref="ExpansionWeight">1/1.7</see>, and keeps the shorter line when stretching
/// wins. <see cref="PrefersShrinking"/> is that comparison.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on 26.2.4.2 by sweeping the text width of the corpus paragraph and reading the first
/// line's decision off both the mode-15 and the mode-12 rendering of it — the mode-12 one being the
/// un-shrunk break, since shrinking is off there. Five widths leave the next word reachable inside the
/// floor; the weighted comparison calls all five, and so does the corpus fixture's second line:

/// word spacing"; **it did not discriminate on any measured line** and the tree's own value for that
/// maximum in this mode is 100%, which would shrink every one of the six rows above and contradicts
