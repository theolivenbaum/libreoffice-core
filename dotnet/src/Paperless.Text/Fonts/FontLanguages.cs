/// DejaVu Sans, <c>fc-match "Calibri:lang=hi:charset=5d0"</c> answers <b>FreeSans</b>, and

/// fontconfig derives a face's language set from its character coverage against an orthography per
/// language, and that data is compiled into the library rather than published in the configuration
/// this tree reads. What is asked here instead is whether the face covers the language's
/// <em>script</em>, keyed by one exemplar character. Checked against <c>fc-list :lang=X</c> on this
/// machine over the 25 languages below, comparing the families each answers: <b>24 agree exactly</b>,
/// face for face. The twenty-fifth, Gurmukhi, differs by naming two <em>fewer</em> — FreeMono, which
/// fontconfig files under <c>pa</c> although it holds none of the Gurmukhi letters checked here. Two
/// exemplars are deliberately not the first letter of their alphabet, because the first letter does
/// not discriminate: an accented Greek vowel excludes a face carrying only the mathematical Greek,
/// and a simplified-only Chinese ideograph excludes a Japanese face carrying only the shared ones.
