/// This is what a <c>.pptx</c> stores in <c>ppt/fonts/*.fntdata</c> and points at from
/// <c>p:embeddedFontLst</c>. <strong>It is not an obfuscated TrueType file</strong>, and the two
/// are easy to confuse because both live under "embedded fonts" in OOXML. The obfuscated form is
/// WordprocessingML's: <c>w:embedRegular</c> carries a <c>w:fontKey</c> GUID and the first 32
/// bytes of the part are XORed with bytes derived from it. PresentationML carries no such key —
/// there is no GUID anywhere in <c>p:embeddedFontLst</c> — and its part is an EOT container,
/// byte for byte unaltered.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// LibreOffice agrees, and the two paths meet in one function:
/// <c>oox::ppt::EmbeddedFontListContext</c> (<c>oox/source/ppt/EmbeddedFontListContext.cxx</c>)
/// calls <c>EmbeddedFontsManager::addEmbeddedFont(stream, typeface, style, key, eot, subsetted)</c>
/// with an <em>empty</em> <c>key</c> and <c>eot = true</c>, so the XOR loop at the top of that
/// function (<c>vcl/source/gdi/embeddedfontsmanager.cxx</c>) runs zero iterations for a deck and
/// is only ever exercised by the Word path, which passes the GUID and <c>eot = false</c>.
/// </para>

/// <strong>Compressed EOT is declined rather than decoded.</strong> The <c>TTEMBED_TTCOMPRESSED</c>
/// flag means the sfnt has been through MicroType Express, a whole codec that LibreOffice delegates
/// to <c>libeot</c> and that has no C# prior art. Measured over the slides track: of 28 embedded
/// font parts across 6 decks, 10 are uncompressed and 18 are MicroType-Express-compressed. A
