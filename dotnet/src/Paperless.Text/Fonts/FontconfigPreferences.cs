/// <para>
/// This exists for one question, asked at the very end of glyph fallback: <em>nothing on
/// LibreOffice's own fallback list is installed and several faces on this machine cover the
/// character — which one does LibreOffice draw it in?</em> The answer is not a property of the
/// fonts. It is a property of the machine's fontconfig configuration, and that was established by
/// measurement rather than assumed: with the machine's <c>/etc/fonts</c> in force,
/// <c>fc-match "宋体:charset=624b"</c> answers <em>WenQuanYi Zen Hei</em>; with a minimal
/// configuration naming only the font directory it answers <em>IPAGothic</em>, because nothing but
/// the scan order then separates the candidates. The difference is
/// <c>/etc/fonts/conf.d/64-wqy-zenhei.conf</c>, which lists WenQuanYi Zen Hei under
/// <c>&lt;alias&gt;&lt;family&gt;sans-serif&lt;/family&gt;&lt;prefer&gt;</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So no rule derived from the font files — code-page bits, Unicode ranges, coverage size, name —
/// can reproduce the reference renderer's choice, and the resolver's previous tie-break
/// (alphabetical by family, which its own comment described as having no basis) put IPAGothic and
/// Unifont ahead of WenQuanYi Zen Hei on every Han character. Reading the configuration is
/// therefore not a second source of truth competing with LibreOffice's substitution table; it is
/// the source of truth for the one decision the table does not make. LibreOffice asks fontconfig
/// through <c>FcFontSetMatch</c> in <c>vcl/unx/generic/font/fontconfig.cxx</c> before it ever
/// consults its own list.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Deliberately narrow. For the preference order, only <c>&lt;alias&gt;</c> elements whose subject
/// is a *generic* family (<c>serif</c>, <c>sans-serif</c>, <c>monospace</c> and friends) and whose
/// body is a <c>&lt;prefer&gt;</c> list are read. The metric-alias files — <c>Helvetica</c>
/// preferring <c>Nimbus Sans</c> — are aliases of a concrete family and say nothing about which
/// face should draw a character nobody's font covers, so they are skipped there. Conditional
/// <c>&lt;match target="pattern"&gt;</c> rules are skipped too: they turn on a language or a size
/// this resolver does not carry, and guessing at their conditions would be worse than not
/// reproducing them.
/// </para>

/// The classification reads the *other* half of the same elements, and reads them for a concrete

/// takes the sans-serif default; <c>Palatino</c> is filed under nothing either but *accepts*
