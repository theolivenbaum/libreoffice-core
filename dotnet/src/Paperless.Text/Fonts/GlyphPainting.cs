/// <strong>The floor under glyph fallback.</strong> A fallback search asks one question — does this
/// face's <c>cmap</c> cover the character — and a face can answer yes and still have nothing to
/// draw with: the glyph's shape may live in a table this renderer does not read. That is exactly
/// what happened when <c>U+2714</c> began resolving to Noto Color Emoji, which carries
/// <c>CBDT</c>/<c>CBLC</c> and neither <c>glyf</c> nor <c>CFF </c>: the right face at the right
/// advance, drawing nothing. A blank where the reference draws a glyph is worse for a reader than a
/// wrong glyph, so a candidate that cannot paint is passed over and the search moves on to the next
/// one — see <c>SystemFontResolver.Covers</c>, which is the single place all three fallback stages
/// go through.

/// Passing over a candidate is a floor and not the fix. The fix is being able to paint it, and for

/// <item><description><strong><c>COLR</c>/<c>CPAL</c> is not read.</strong> A layered colour glyph
/// is a list of ordinary outlines each carrying a palette colour, which this renderer could compose
/// — but <em>no face installed on this machine carries the tables</em> and no corpus document
/// reaches one, so there is nothing to measure an implementation against. Such a face is reported
/// unpaintable here and the fallback search moves to the next candidate, which draws the character
/// in a monochrome face rather than leaving a blank.</description></item>

/// and draws such a face correctly, and only the PDF writer declines to embed the program — see
/// <c>PdfFontCatalogue.IsCompactFontFormat</c>, which names a face it cannot embed and keeps its
/// widths, so the pen positions and the line breaks are unchanged and a reader substitutes a face.
/// Rejecting CFF here would move a line break to work around a writer.
