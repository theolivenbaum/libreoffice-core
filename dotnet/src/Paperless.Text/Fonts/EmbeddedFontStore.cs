/// <para>
/// <strong>The key has to be a path, and that is the whole reason this type exists.</strong>
/// Resolution ends at a <see cref="FontReference"/>, and every consumer downstream of it reads
/// <c>FaceKey</c> as <c>path</c> or <c>path#index</c> and opens the file:
/// <c>SystemFontResolver.LoadFace</c>, <c>FileFontProvider</c> for PDF output, and
/// <c>SkiaDrawingSink.TypefaceFor</c> for raster output. A key those cannot open does not fail
/// loudly — the PDF <em>names</em> the face and embeds nothing, which the gate reads as
/// <c>unembedded</c> and a reader shows in a substituted face. That exact defect has been found
/// twice before in this tree, once on decks and once on spreadsheets; see the remarks on
/// <c>SlideTextLayout.Run</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the bytes are written out, which is also what LibreOffice does with them:
/// <c>EmbeddedFontsManager::addEmbeddedFont</c> ends in <c>writeFontBytesToFile</c> and registers
/// the resulting URL, for the same reason — the layer that draws takes a file.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Content-addressed and process-scoped. Content-addressed because a deck embeds one face and
/// draws with it on every slide, and because two decks in one batch run routinely embed the same
/// face; process-scoped because the alternatives are worse in both directions — a store shared
/// between processes cannot be cleaned up by any of them, and one scoped to a document is gone by
/// the time a caller that lays out, disposes and then renders reaches the renderer.
