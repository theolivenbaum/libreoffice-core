/// <strong>This is a metric, not an outline, and the distinction is the reason it is not part of
/// <see cref="GlyphOutlines"/>.</strong> Every <c>glyf</c> record opens with a ten-byte header
/// carrying the glyph's own bounding box, so an extent costs two <c>loca</c> reads and four
/// big-endian shorts — no contour decoding, no composite recursion, and nothing that would tempt a
/// caller to draw text as paths. <see cref="GlyphOutlines"/> exists for Fontwork alone and says so
/// at its head; widening it to serve a measurement would blur that.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What needs it is a clip.</strong> LibreOffice decides whether a shape's text survives a
/// <c>vertOverflow="clip"</c> body by the ink of each drawn portion rather than by the line box it
/// sits in: <c>TextHierarchyBreakupBlockText::processDrawPortionInfo</c> keeps a portion only when
/// its start position and both corners of <c>TextLayouterDevice::getTextBoundRect</c> fall inside
/// the clip range (<c>svx/source/svdraw/svdoutl.cxx</c>:120-160). So a descender decides it: at 16 pt
/// in a 33 pt button, DejaVu Sans draws <c>Icon sets</c> and drops <c>Inventory list</c>, and the
/// only difference between them is the <c>y</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A composite glyph's own header records the assembled box, so accented Latin answers correctly
/// without following its components. A face carrying no <c>glyf</c> — every CFF face — answers null,
/// and the caller falls back to the font's declared descent, which over-clips rather than
/// under-clips and is what the line box gave before.
