/// is not a quirk of the corpus: it is <c>cloneAndDeduplicateSprm</c>
/// (<c>sw/source/writerfilter/rtftok/rtfsprm.cxx</c>:290-340), whose <em>"not found - try to

/// as direct formatting for every paragraph property the <em>named</em> style states and the
/// paragraph does not. So the named style's own <c>\sb \sa \li \ri \fi \sl</c> are each reset to
/// RTF's default before they can reach the text, and an ancestor's are not, because
/// <c>lcl_copyFlatten</c> (<c>rtfdocumentimpl.cxx</c>:490-514) flattens only the entry's own
