/// Nearly everything this project measures is a place where LibreOffice is right about a file and
/// this tree was wrong, and those are simply fixed. A handful are the other way round — the

/// need a decision rather than a fix, because the gate scores this tree against 26.2.4.2's own
/// output and reproducing the quirk is what makes the gate green.

/// <para>
/// <strong>The decision is Word.</strong> A reader wants the document as its author saw it, so
/// where the two disagree this tree follows the writing application and accepts the gate row.
/// Every such place is implemented anyway, behind <see cref="Variable"/>, so a run that wants to
/// agree with a local LibreOffice can have it — and so that the measurement survives, which is the
/// expensive half. <c>dotnet/TODO.word-parity.md</c> lists them, what each one costs, and the
/// corpus rows to stop chasing.

/// <para>
/// This is deliberately one switch rather than one per rule. It is a statement about which
/// application the output should resemble, and a caller that wants half of LibreOffice's answer
