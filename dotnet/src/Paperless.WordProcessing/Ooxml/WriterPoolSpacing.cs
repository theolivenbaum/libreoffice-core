/// pool with its own spacing, font and outline level. The imported properties are applied on top,

/// That is normally invisible, because the importer clears the pool style's direct values first.
/// It becomes visible through <see cref="WordStyles.CompleteOneSidedSpacing"/>, where a
/// half-stated <c>w:spacing</c> freezes the other half at whatever the style resolves to at that
/// point in the import — the style's own pool row when Writer has one under its <c>w:name</c>,
/// and otherwise its parent's, a parent whose own definition has not been reached yet still
/// holding exactly these numbers. Which of the two it is was measured separately; see the
/// remarks on <see cref="WordStyles.CompleteOneSidedSpacing"/>.

/// <para>
/// The table is measured rather than read off <c>DocumentStylePoolManager.cxx</c>, because the
/// source's <c>bNoDefault</c> guard says these should not apply at all and they demonstrably do.
/// Each row is one rendered probe against LibreOffice 24.2.7.2: a child style based on a parent of
/// that name, declared before it, stating one of the two margins and reading back the other. The
/// three non-zero groups line up with the pool declarations at
/// <c>sw/source/core/doc/DocumentStylePoolManager.cxx:810</c> (the <c>Heading</c> base, 12 pt and
/// 6 pt), <c>:699</c> (<c>Text body</c>, nought and 7 pt) and <c>:974</c> (<c>Caption</c>, 6 pt
/// and 6 pt), which is the check that the measurement is describing a real rule and not a
/// coincidence.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Anything not named here measured as nought above and nought below, which is also the honest
/// default: a name Writer does not recognise becomes a brand-new style with no spacing at all.

/// [24.2.7-audit: VERIFIED 2026-08-21, round words-r56 — the whole table re-measured on 26.2.4.2,
/// both halves of every row, by `probes/words-r56/audit_poolspacing.py`. 27 of the 28 names it
/// tests answer exactly what this class claims, including the three that claim nothing (`Quote`,
/// `Normal`, `List Paragraph`). The one exception is the row the paragraph on `ChildKeeps` had
/// already put in doubt — lower-case `body text` answers nought on both sides, not 0/140 — and it
/// is now removed rather than left standing, which is what that paragraph asked the round that
/// re-measured the table to do. Zero corpus documents name a parent that way and 80 name
/// `Body Text`, so the correction has no reach and is made because it is true.
/// **The probe's own first run reported nine rows wrong and every one was an artefact**: it named
/// the two case variants of a heading `heading-5` and `Heading-5`, which are one file on this
/// mount, and a missing conversion reads as nought which reads as a finding. It now numbers its
/// packages and refuses to print anything unless every conversion produced output.]
