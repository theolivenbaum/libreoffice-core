/// The mechanism this states is Writer's own: <c>SvxFontItem</c>'s family defaults to

/// <c>FC_FAMILY</c> for it — so the pre-match asks fontconfig for <c>"Aptos"</c>-or-<c>"serif"</c>
/// and gets DejaVu Serif, where a bare <c>fc-match Aptos</c> gets DejaVu Sans. The DOCX and DOC
/// filters overwrite that default from their font tables; the RTF filter does not, which is why its
/// <c>\fswiss</c> is inert. The ODF and spreadsheet/presentation filters do not go through this
/// default at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>And the declared class is inherited rather than looked up per name — measured in round
/// 55, after round 54 shipped the per-name reading and lost a verdict to it.</strong> Through a
/// DOCX the class is set only where <c>w:rFonts/@w:ascii</c> names a font the font table files
/// under <c>roman</c> or <c>swiss</c>; <c>auto</c>, <c>modern</c>, a pitch-only entry, an absent
/// entry and <c>w:asciiTheme</c> all leave whatever an ancestor put there, and nothing anywhere
/// stating one leaves it roman. So this method's second argument is <em>the class in force at the
/// run</em>, which <see cref="Ooxml.WordParagraphFormats.StatedClass"/> resolves from the layer
/// stack — not the class of the family the run names. The DOC arm keeps handing over the
/// named font's own <c>FFN</c> class, because <c>SwWW8ImplReader</c> builds an
/// <c>SvxFontItem</c> per font there and there is no inheritance to model.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Only the declared class is read, never the declared pitch.</b> Both are in every one of these
/// font tables and only the first moves the reference: <c>Aptos</c> declared <c>pitch="fixed"</c>
