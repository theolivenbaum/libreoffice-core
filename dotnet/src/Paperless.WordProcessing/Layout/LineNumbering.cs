/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Word states this per section, in <c>w:sectPr/w:lnNumType</c>, and Writer holds it per <em>document</em>
/// — <c>SwDoc::GetLineNumberInfo</c> returns one <c>SwLineNumberInfo</c> for the whole file. The DOCX
/// importer says so in as many words: <em>"line numbering in Writer is a global document setting, in Word
/// is a section setting; if line numbering is switched on anywhere in the document it's set at the global
/// settings"</em> (<c>sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/DomainMapper.cxx</c>:1213). So this sits on
/// <see cref="PaginationOptions"/> beside the other document-wide choices rather than on a section, which
/// is not a simplification but the behaviour being reproduced.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>What is numbered.</b> Body text lines, and only those: not a header, not a footer, not a footnote,
/// not a text frame (<c>m_bCountInFlys</c> is false by default and the DOCX importer sets
/// <c>CountLinesInFrames</c> false explicitly), and — measured on the reference rather than read — not a
/// table. On page 11 of <c>xx_SETIS_PWS_template_10.19.22.docx</c> the numbers run 364…384 down to the
/// line above the table and resume at 385 on the first body line below it, so the table's own lines
/// neither carry a number nor advance the count. An empty paragraph <em>is</em> numbered
/// (<c>m_bCountBlankLines</c> defaults true, and 366, 368 and 371 on that page are blank).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Where.</b> Right-aligned, its right edge <see cref="Distance"/> in from the text's left edge, on the
/// line's own baseline. Right-aligned is measured, not assumed: on that document the one-digit numbers sit
/// at x=52.95, the two-digit ones at 47.95 and the three-digit ones at 42.95, which is one 5 pt digit
/// advance apart each time and a right edge fixed at 57.95 pt against a 72.1 pt text edge — 0.5 cm, which
/// is <c>SwLineNumberInfo</c>'s own default (<c>o3tl::toTwips(5, mm)</c>, <c>lineinfo.cxx</c>:55) and the
/// value the importer substitutes when <c>w:distance</c> is absent (<c>DomainMapper.cxx</c>:2818).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The size is the document's default character size, not the paragraph's.</b> Writer's
/// <c>Line Numbering</c> character style is created with no attributes at all
/// (<c>DocumentStylePoolManager.cxx</c>:1593 falls through the switch), so it inherits the document's
/// default. Established on four authored probes rendered through 26.2.4.2: with no <c>w:sz</c> in
/// <c>docDefaults</c> the numbers come out 10 pt whether <c>Normal</c> says 12 pt or 20 pt, and with
/// <c>docDefaults</c> at 10 pt they come out 10 pt. One thing those probes show that is <em>not</em>
/// modelled here: a <c>docDefaults</c> of 20, 24 or 32 pt all draw at 11.70 pt, so LibreOffice caps the
/// size somewhere. No corpus document states a default size, so the cap is recorded and left alone rather
/// than guessed at.
