/// What a continuous section break does with the page properties its own section states.

/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A continuous section has no page of its own, so it has no page style of its own, so its
/// <c>w:pgMar</c> and its running head are both inert unless something gives them a page to land
/// on.</strong> That is one rule and not two, and it decides paper size, margins, header, footer,
/// numbering format and number restart together, because in Writer all six live on a page descriptor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>SectionPropertyMap::CloseSectionGroup</c>'s continuous branch
/// (<c>sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/PropertyMap.cxx</c>:1722-1852) inserts a Writer <em>text</em>
/// section and then calls <c>InheritOrFinalizePageStyles</c>, which hands the section the previous
/// one's page style outright whenever it has not created one of its own (<c>:1309-1323</c>). It creates
/// one only because <c>DomainMapper_Impl::PushPageHeaderFooter</c> called <c>GetPageStyle</c> while
/// importing a header or footer the section named (<c>DomainMapper_Impl.cxx</c>:4169) — so a section
/// that names none never has a style to apply, and one that names one has a style that no page yet
/// uses. Attaching it is the <c>else if</c> at <c>:1746</c>, guarded on some slot <em>not</em> being
/// linked to the previous section: it walks the section's own paragraphs for the first carrying
/// <c>BreakType_PAGE_BEFORE</c> and sets <c>PageDescName</c> — and the page number offset — on that one
/// (<c>:1794-1801</c>), failing that on the previous section's last paragraph if that carries one.
/// With no such paragraph anywhere the style stays orphaned and every page keeps the section above's.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The WW8 reader states the same rule in its own words and its own code, under the comment <em>"In
/// this nightmare scenario the continuous section has its own headers and footers so we will try and
/// find a hard page break between here and the end of the section and put the headers and footers
/// there"</em> — and caches the descriptor so that it can put the old one back when the search fails:
/// <c>if (bFailed) aIter-&gt;mpPage = pOrig</c> (<c>sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8par.cxx</c>:4515-4560).
/// RTF reaches the dmapper rule, since writerfilter serves both.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Measured on <c>hdss-bulletin-issue-285-25-june-2025.docx</c> against 26.2.4.2</strong>
/// (<c>dotnet/probes/words-continuous-r72/</c>), whose second section is continuous, names
/// <c>header2.xml</c> and states <c>w:top="1418"</c> where the first section states
/// <c>w:top="454" w:header="340"</c>. Four one-attribute mutations settle both halves at once:
/// putting section 2's <c>w:top</c> to 3000 twips moves the reference's page 2 not at all, and neither
/// does the same change to section 3, which contains a hard page break but names no furniture;
/// giving section 2's first paragraph a <c>w:pageBreakBefore</c> makes the reference apply the header
/// <em>and</em> the 1418-twip margin from that page on, page for page and point for point with ours.
/// So the geometry travels with the header and dies with it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>And that is where the reference's page-2 body comes from.</strong> Every page keeps section
/// 1's descriptor, whose header is a single empty paragraph in the <c>Header</c> style — 9 pt Arial,
/// resolving to Liberation Sans. Writer's top margin is that section's <c>w:header</c>, 340 twips =
/// 17.00 pt; <c>PrepareHeaderFooterProperties</c> makes the header's declared height
/// <c>w:top − w:header</c> = 5.70 pt and its body distance that less 1 mm = 2.865 pt
/// (<c>PropertyMap.cxx</c>:1148-1195); the paragraph is 10.35 pt tall, which is more than the declared
/// height, and a DOCX header is imported dynamic-height with dynamic spacing, so it eats the whole of
/// the distance. The body therefore starts at 17.00 + 10.35 = <strong>27.35 pt</strong>, and the first
/// line — <c>Body</c>, <c>w:line="280" w:lineRule="atLeast"</c>, natural height 12.07 pt — puts its
/// baseline 14 pt less its descent below that, at <strong>39.12 pt</strong> against the reference's
/// measured 39.10. Nothing in either section's <c>w:top</c> is 39.1 pt because the number is not a
/// margin: it is the first section's margin plus its empty header.
/// </para>

/// document's first — 23 such sections whose descriptor lands nowhere and 4 that land at a hard break
/// (<c>census.py</c>). The figure recorded by the previous round, 16, counted seven documents whose
