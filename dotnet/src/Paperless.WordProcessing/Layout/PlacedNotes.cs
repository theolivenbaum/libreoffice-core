/// A note belongs to the page holding the <em>line</em> that contains its anchor. That rule is easy to
/// state and was, until this existed, implemented twice over the body flow alone — once in
/// <see cref="Paginator"/>, to charge the page for the room the note takes, and once in
/// <see cref="NoteRenumbering"/>, to count a page's notes for a per-page restart. Both walked the
/// paragraphs of the top-level flow and neither descended into a table, so a footnote cited from a table
/// cell was read, numbered and then silently dropped: no room was reserved for it, nothing drew it, and
/// the only visible trace was a page short by the note's words.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on the words track: three documents cite a footnote from inside a table
/// (<c>TE.CAO.00125 … OJT Logbook</c>, <c>FO.FCTOA.00010 …</c> and
/// <c>EHEST-SMS-Safety-Management-Manual-V2</c>) and the reference draws every one of them at the foot of
/// the citing page, exactly as it draws a footnote cited from body text. LibreOffice makes no distinction
/// at all — <c>SwTextFrame::ConnectFootnote</c> hangs the note on the page frame the citing text frame is
/// in, whatever chain of cell and table frames lies between them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A <em>placed</em> flow rather than a paragraph and a line range, because that is what a table gives:
/// <see cref="TableLayouter.SliceRow"/> hands back cells holding only the lines that fit above the cut, so
/// walking those lines is what makes a split row charge each of its two pages for the notes that page
/// draws and no others.
