/// A document that says its page is 11912 twips wide is saying 21012 hundredths of a millimetre,
/// which is A4 plus a tenth of a millimetre — a rounding scar left by a round trip through inches
/// or through some other application's units, not a decision anyone made. Word's own file format
/// carries these constantly, and LibreOffice's importers erase them: every Word-family reader
/// passes each page dimension through a nearest-standard-dimension fit before the value reaches
/// the layout.

/// The three call sites are <c>DomainMapper.cxx</c>:827 and :836 for <c>w:pgSz</c> (which serves
/// RTF as well, since <c>rtfdispatchvalue.cxx</c>:1274-1289 dispatches <c>\paperw</c> and friends
/// through the same <c>LN_CT_PageSz_w</c>/<c>_h</c> cases) and <c>ww8par6.cxx</c>:521 and :1083 for
/// DOC. ODF is deliberately not in that list: an ODF document states its page in the same

/// **It fits one dimension at a time, against every dimension in the table.** A width is compared
/// against each standard paper's *height* as well as its width, so a page 364 mm wide snaps to
/// 364 mm — B4(JIS)'s height, and no paper's width. Measured on the installed 26.2.4.2: a stated
/// 20638 × 25000 twips comes back 1031.81 pt wide, which is 364 mm exactly, while 20500 twips at
/// the same height comes back unchanged. There is no notion of a matching *format* here, and a
/// page can leave this function as the width of one paper and the height of another.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// **The window is 0.44 mm and the comparison is strict.** <c>MAXSLOPPY</c> is
/// <c>PT2MM100(1.25)</c>, which is 44 hundredths of a millimetre after its round-half-up, and the
/// test is <c>&lt; 44</c> rather than <c>&lt;=</c>. Measured on 26.2.4.2 by sweeping a stated A4
/// height one twip at a time: 16814 through 16862 twips all come back 841.89 pt, 16813 and 16863
/// come back unchanged. Those are exactly the twips whose hundredths-of-a-millimetre value lands
/// strictly inside 29700 ± 44.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// **The comparison happens in hundredths of a millimetre, not in twips**, so the input's own
/// conversion rounding is part of the rule. 16813 twips is 29656.26 hundredths, which rounds to
/// 29656 and is 44 away — outside. A twip-domain window would have let it in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The table is <c>aDinTab</c> from <c>i18nutil/source/utility/paper.cxx</c>, transcribed in its
/// own order and verified entry for entry against that file. **The order is load-bearing**: the
/// fit returns the first entry within the window, and eleven pairs of distinct dimensions in the
/// table sit closer together than two window widths — 21519 and 21590 (Quarto's width and
/// Letter's) are 0.71 mm apart, so a page between them can be within reach of both and the answer
/// is whichever comes first. The <c>PAPER_USER</c> row, which is 0 × 0 and would swallow every
/// small dimension, is skipped there and is simply absent here.
