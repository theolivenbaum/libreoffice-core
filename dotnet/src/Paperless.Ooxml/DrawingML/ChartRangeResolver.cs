/// (<c>oox/source/drawingml/chart/chartconverter.cxx:117-152</c>), reads the cached points and
/// ignores the formula — right for Impress and Writer, where the data lives in a second document
/// this reader must not open. Calc overrides it:
/// <c>ExcelChartConverter::createDataSequence</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/excelchartconverter.cxx:65-105</c>) parses the formula and resolves
/// it against the workbook, and falls back to the cache <em>only</em> when there is no formula at
/// all. The formula wins outright; the cache is the fallback, not the source.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The difference is not academic.</strong> A workbook whose chart plots a pivot table
/// writes a cache one point shorter than the range it declares — the grand-total row is stated in
/// <c>c:f</c> and absent from <c>c:numCache</c> — so a cache-only reader draws the chart without
/// its largest value and scales the axis to the rest. Measured on
/// <c>Keywords_Mapping_Graphs_and_Charts.xlsx</c>: eleven charts, twenty-two sequences, every one
/// of them exactly one cell short, and a value axis running to 8 where the reference runs to 40.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A <see langword="null"/> resolver — the default everywhere but the spreadsheet readers — leaves
/// the cache-only behaviour exactly as it was, which is what the presentation and word-processing
/// paths need and is why this is a parameter rather than a change of rule.
