/// <para>
/// A diagram is five parts, not four. <c>dgm:relIds</c> names <em>four</em> — <c>r:dm</c> the
/// data model, <c>r:lo</c> the layout definition, <c>r:qs</c> the quick style and <c>r:cs</c>
/// the colour transform — and the fifth, the one worth having, is not among them. PowerPoint
/// also writes <c>diagrams/drawingN.xml</c>: a <c>dsp:spTree</c> holding the diagram
/// <em>already laid out</em>, one shape per node with real geometry, fills, lines and text.
/// Reaching it means going through the data model, whose
/// <c>dgm:extLst/a:ext/dsp:dataModelExt/@relId</c> names a relationship of Microsoft's own
/// <c>…/2007/relationships/diagramDrawing</c> type.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>That relationship is declared on the part holding the shape, not on the data part.</strong>
/// It is the data part that carries the id and the <em>slide</em> that resolves it, which is the
/// trap in this feature: <c>ppt/diagrams/_rels/data1.xml.rels</c> usually does not exist at all,
/// and where it does it holds the diagram's images under ids that collide with the slide's. In
/// <c>sd/qa/unit/data/pptx/smartart-picture-strip.pptx</c> the drawing's <c>rId1</c> is
/// <c>image1.png</c> and the slide's <c>rId1</c> is <c>slideLayout1.xml</c>, so resolving
/// against the wrong part does not fail — it silently finds something else.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// LibreOffice does exactly this, in <c>loadDiagram</c>
/// (<c>oox/source/drawingml/diagram/diagram.cxx:608-624</c>): it collects the <c>relId</c>s the
/// data model's <c>dsp:dataModelExt</c> elements carry, resolves each against
/// <c>rRelations</c> — the relations of the part being imported — and keeps only those that
/// resolve. The layout-atom evaluator runs only when none does
/// (<c>diagram.cxx:701</c>, <c>bCreate = pShape-&gt;getExtDrawings().empty()</c>).
/// </para>

/// <c>dsp:sp</c> elements rather than trusting the relationship — <c>DiagramShapeCounter</c>,
/// <c>diagram.cxx:521-556</c>, and "Ignore ext drawings which don't actually have any shapes".
/// 15 of the 86 diagram documents in LibreOffice's own corpus have a drawing part of exactly
/// 436 bytes whose <c>dsp:spTree</c> holds nothing but its <c>dsp:nvGrpSpPr</c> — somebody
/// stripped them so the layout-atom evaluator is what gets tested. <c>smartart-org-chart.pptx</c>
