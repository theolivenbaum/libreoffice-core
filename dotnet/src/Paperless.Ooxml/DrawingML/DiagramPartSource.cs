/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A diagram is the same five parts in a deck, a document and a workbook, and nothing about
/// resolving them is family-specific — so this stands where the resolution does, rather than
/// each family re-deriving it against its own package type. It is two delegates and not an
/// interface because that is the whole of the dependency: every family already has a package
/// object that answers both, and neither has any business knowing what a diagram is.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The relationship is scoped to the part that states it</strong>, which is why
/// <see cref="Target"/> takes the owning part's name rather than resolving against the package's
/// main part. A <c>dgm:relIds</c> in <c>word/document.xml</c> resolves against
/// <c>word/_rels/document.xml.rels</c>, one in a header against that header's own, and one on a
/// slide against the slide's. Resolving against the wrong part does not fail — it silently finds
/// whatever that part happens to call <c>rId9</c>.
