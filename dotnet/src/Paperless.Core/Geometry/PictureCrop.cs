/// what wanted it, and it is stated by all three families under three different spellings:
/// DrawingML's <c>a:srcRect</c>/<c>a:fillRect</c>, ODF's <c>fo:clip</c>, and Escher's
/// <c>cropFromTop</c> and its three siblings, which DOC, XLS and PPT all share because they all
/// delegate their drawings to MS-ODRAW. A reader in <c>Paperless.WordProcessing</c> cannot reach
/// a sibling of its own library, so leaving the arithmetic in the presentation layer meant
/// porting it once per family. It depends on nothing but <see cref="DocRect"/> and
/// <see cref="Length"/>, so it passes the rule Core is kept by: a thing belongs here when it
/// depends on nothing above Core, whatever it was written for.
