/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The format.</strong> A <c>hyph_*.dic</c> is a plain text file: an encoding name on the
/// first line, then keyword lines, then one TeX-style pattern per line. A pattern is letters with
/// digits interleaved between them — <c>hy3ph</c> says "value 3 between <c>y</c> and <c>p</c> in
/// any word containing <c>hyph</c>" — and a leading or trailing <c>.</c> anchors the pattern to
/// the start or the end of the word. Liang's algorithm lays every matching pattern over the word
/// and keeps the largest value at each position; an odd value is a hyphenation point and an even
/// one forbids it. Lines beginning with <c>%</c> are comments.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The minima are read out of the file, not written down here.</strong>
/// <c>LEFTHYPHENMIN</c> and <c>RIGHTHYPHENMIN</c> say how many characters must remain on each
/// side of the break; <c>hyph_en_US.dic</c> states 2 and 3, <c>hyph_fr.dic</c> 2 and 2. They are
/// floored at 2 because that is what LibreOffice does with them:
/// <c>lingucomponent/source/hyphenator/hyphen/hyphenimp.cxx</c>:435 passes
/// <c>std::max&lt;sal_Int16&gt;(dict-&gt;lhmin, 2)</c> into libhyphen, and the linguistic
/// property that can raise them further defaults to 2 as well
/// (<c>linguistic/source/lngprophelp.cxx</c>:492-493). <strong>Read out of this tree, which is
/// 27.2 alpha rather than the 26.2.4.2 reference binary; the behaviour is confirmed
/// independently against that binary in <c>probes/hyphen-r106</c>.</strong>
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What this deliberately does not implement.</strong> Non-standard hyphenation — the
/// <c>pattern/replacement,cut,pos</c> form that spells German <c>Zuk-ker</c> for <c>Zucker</c> —
/// is skipped rather than approximated, because a wrong replacement changes the characters on
/// the page and not merely where they break. None of the four pattern files LibreOffice 26.2.4.2
/// ships uses it. <c>NEXTLEVEL</c> splits a file into a compound-boundary level and an ordinary
/// level; the ordinary one is the last, and that is the one kept, which is also the only one
/// <c>hyph_fr.dic</c> has anything in.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two normalisations happen before matching, both of them LibreOffice's
/// (<c>hyphenimp.cxx</c>:315-330): curly quotes and apostrophes are folded to straight ones,
/// because the patterns are written with straight ones, and the word is lower-cased. The folding
/// is done character by character so the result is the same length as the input — an offset into
/// a re-cased string is not an offset into the caller's word, and a length change would silently
/// move every point after it.
