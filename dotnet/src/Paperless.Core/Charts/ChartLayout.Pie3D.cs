/// A three-dimensional pie: the extruded solid 26.2.4.2 draws for a <c>c:pie3DChart</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The reference rasterises this chart, so every law here was fitted to a bitmap.</strong>
/// A 3-D chart reaches the page as one <c>Do</c> of an RGB image with a soft mask — the labels
/// and the chart's frame are still operators, the solid is not — so there is no vector geometry
/// to compare against and no prospect of a byte-equal rendering. What can be measured exactly is
/// the silhouette, and <c>probes/pie3d-r187</c> does: 36 one-attribute rewrites of a corpus
/// document's own chart part, nine elevations by four depths, each rendered through 26.2.4.2 and
/// each solid's outline fitted.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The projection is parallel.</strong> Fitting the silhouette's upper boundary as an
/// ellipse over every column of the bitmap leaves a mean residual of <strong>0.28 to 0.45
/// pixels</strong> at all nine elevations, on images 1370 pixels wide. A perspective projection
/// would not be an ellipse and that residual is how one would know. It says so although
/// <c>View3DConverter::convertFromModel</c> asks for <c>ProjectionMode_PERSPECTIVE</c> — a
/// <c>c:perspective</c> of 30 halves to 15, and 15 is not zero
/// (<c>oox/source/drawingml/chart/plotareaconverter.cxx</c>:299-308) — because the camera is far
/// enough away that the conic is an ellipse to within the raster.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The squash is the sine of the elevation.</strong> Measured
/// <c>B/A</c> against <c>sin(rotX)</c> over the nine: 0.164/0.174, 0.340/0.342, 0.499/0.500,
/// 0.647/0.643, 0.763/0.766, 0.866/0.866, 0.939/0.940, 0.966/0.985, 0.997/1.000 — within
/// <strong>0.7% at seven of the nine</strong>, and the two that miss (10° and 80°) are where the
/// silhouette is hardest to fit, one because the ellipse is nearly a line and the other because
/// it is nearly a circle.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong><c>c:depthPercent</c> is not read, and that is measured rather than assumed.</strong>
/// The same document at 20, 50, 100 and 200 gives geometry identical to the hundredth of a point
/// at every one of the nine elevations. The pie branch of <c>View3DConverter</c> never passes it
/// on; the depth comes from the diagram's preferred aspect ratio, which
/// <c>PieChart::getPreferredDiagramAspectRatio</c> states as <c>(1, 1, 0.10)</c>
/// (<c>chart2/source/view/charttypes/PieChart.cxx</c>:252-256).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The solid is fitted to the plot area isotropically.</strong> A unit disc of diameter 1
/// and thickness <see cref="Thickness"/> projects to a box 1 wide and
/// <c>sin θ + 0.10·cos θ</c> tall, and the scale is whichever of the two limits binds. Predicted
/// against measured width over the nine elevations: 478/478, 478/480, 477/469, 388/386, 337/341,
/// 308/308, 288/290, 284/290, 280/280 — <strong>within 2% at every one</strong>, and the
/// changeover from width-limited to height-limited between 20° and 30° is reproduced. The
/// depth is the weaker half: 45/50, 41/43, 30/30, 22/20, 16/13, 10/8 over 20° to 70°, so it is
/// right to about a fifth at the ends and to a twentieth of the figure's height throughout.
/// </para>
