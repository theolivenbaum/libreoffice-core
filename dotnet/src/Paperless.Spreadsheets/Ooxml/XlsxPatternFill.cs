/// (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/stylesbuffer.cxx</c>:1978-2056) does not draw the pattern: it
/// <strong>mixes</strong> the pattern colour into the fill colour by a weight the pattern name
/// alone decides, and stores the single blended colour. <c>lclGetMixedColor</c> (<c>:1846-1856</c>)
/// is <c>(pattern − fill) × alpha / 0x80 + fill</c> per component, in integer arithmetic, and
/// <c>alpha</c> comes from the seventeen-entry switch at <c>:2014-2035</c>. A solid fill is the
/// same arithmetic at <c>alpha = 0x80</c>, which returns the pattern colour exactly — so the
/// solid case is not a special case, it is the general one at full weight.

/// Both readers used to take one of the two colours whole. That is right for a solid fill and

/// draw the planned, actual and overrun bands each state the <em>same</em> foreground — the
/// theme's accent — over three different backgrounds, so taking the foreground drew all three in
/// one dark colour indistinguishable from the solid rule above them. At <c>lightUp</c>'s
/// <c>alpha = 0x20</c> they come out <c>#DCD5DC</c>, <c>#D6BCA8</c> and <c>#B5A1B5</c>, which is
