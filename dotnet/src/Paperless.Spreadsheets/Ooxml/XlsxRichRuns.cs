/// of a <c>CT_Font</c> were being read and four were not. The pattern is worth naming — this record
/// is a <em>subset</em> of a schema type, and every field left out of it is silently discarded
/// rather than failing anywhere. <c>vertAlign</c> is the one still missing, and it is left out
/// deliberately: a raised run has nowhere to store its magnitude and must also make its line
