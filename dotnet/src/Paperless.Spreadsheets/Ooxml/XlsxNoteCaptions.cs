/// of sheet", which prints an address and a note on pages of its own, while this is the caption a
/// user pinned open, which Calc keeps in the drawing layer and prints where it sits
/// (<c>PrintDrawingLayer(SC_LAYER_INTERN)</c>, <c>sc/source/ui/view/printfun.cxx:1713</c>). A
/// workbook can have neither, either or both.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Visibility is the VML shape's CSS, not the <c>x:Visible</c> element beside it.</strong>
/// <c>Comment::finalizeImport</c> reads <c>pVmlNoteShape-&gt;getTypeModel().mbVisible</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/commentsbuffer.cxx:257</c>), which is
/// <c>style='…;visibility:visible'</c>. Excel writes <c>&lt;x:Visible/&gt;</c> on shapes it also
/// marks <c>visibility:hidden</c> — three of the four notes on one corpus sheet do exactly that —
/// so keying on the element shows comments the reference does not.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The rectangle comes from <c>x:Anchor</c>, and only from the CSS when there is
/// none.</strong> <c>ShapeBase::calcShapeRectangle</c> tries the client anchor first and falls
/// back to the style's <c>margin-left</c> and friends
/// (<c>oox/source/vml/vmlshape.cxx:509-517</c>). The two disagree on real files: on
/// <c>Application_Compliance_Checklist_5_Apr_2021.xlsx</c> the CSS puts the first caption at
/// 1013.25 pt and the anchor at 1067.6 pt, and LibreOffice's own flat-ODF export of that workbook
/// reports the anchor's answer.

/// <c>ShapeAnchor::importVmlAnchor</c> sets <c>CellAnchorType::Pixel</c>

/// through <c>Unit::ScreenX</c>, which is 96 per inch. Checked against LibreOffice 24.2.7.2's own
/// export of the workbook above: all four of its shown captions come back within two hundredths of
/// a millimetre of the rectangle this arithmetic produces, and the CSS rectangle is out by inches.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>One known difference, and it is in the height.</strong> Calc freezes the caption's size
/// at import — <c>ScNoteUtil::CreateNoteData</c> stores <c>maCaptionSize</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/core/data/postit.cxx:973</c>) and the caption is placed later at that size
/// relative to its cell — so a caption spanning rows whose heights the optimal-height pass then
/// changes keeps the height the file's own <c>ht</c> values gave it. Here the anchor is resolved
/// against the grid the page is drawn on, so such a caption is as tall as its rows end up. It
/// moves no text and it is not corrected, because separating the two grids costs a second
