/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>None of it was read, in any format.</strong> Every shape on every worksheet was drawn
/// as bare text over whatever was under it. Censused whole-corpus over the <c>xlsx</c> family
/// (<c>probes/sheet-fill-r84/census.py</c>): <b>644 <c>xdr:sp</c> in 49 documents</b>, of which
/// 421 state an <c>a:solidFill</c> of their own, 205 an <c>a:ln/a:solidFill</c> and 583 an
/// <c>xdr:style</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The style reference is far less of the work than a count of it suggests, and that is
/// worth stating because the shape of the feature depends on it.</strong> Of those 583 styled
/// shapes <b>497 also state a fill of their own</b>, and the shape's own statement wins —
/// <c>Shape::getActualFillProperties</c> takes the theme as the base and <c>assignUsed</c>s the
/// shape's over it (<c>oox/source/drawingml/shape.cxx</c>). Resolved per shape, the effective
/// source of a fill across the corpus is: <b>421 the shape's own <c>a:solidFill</c>, 54 a theme
/// solid fill, 32 a theme gradient, 98 <c>a:grpFill</c>, 29 <c>a:noFill</c> and 10
/// <c>a:blipFill</c></b>. So the format matrix decides 86 shapes in 3 documents; what really is
/// needed everywhere is theme <em>colour</em> resolution, because 332 of the 626 explicit colour
/// references are an <c>a:schemeClr</c> sitting on the shape's own fill.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The reader is <c>DocxFrames.Appearance</c>'s shape, deliberately: a shape's own fill wins over
/// the matrix, an <c>a:ln</c> is laid <em>over</em> the theme's rather than replacing it — so a
/// shape stating a colour and no width takes the theme's width — and <c>a:noFill</c> inside the
/// line beats the matrix outright. A pattern or a picture fill is a real fill this cannot yet
/// draw, and painting its first colour flat would be a confident wrong answer rather than an
/// absent one.
