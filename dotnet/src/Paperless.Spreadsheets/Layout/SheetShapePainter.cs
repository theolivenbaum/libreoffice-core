/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Every run is measured at its own size and in its own face.</strong> A paragraph is not
/// one size and one face: <c>TextRun::insertAt</c> pushes each run's character properties
/// separately (<c>oox/source/drawingml/textrun.cxx:82-86</c>) and the EditEngine breaks a portion
/// at every one of those boundaries, so a paragraph mixing 11 pt body text with a 12 pt trailing
/// space wraps the body at eleven. Collapsing a paragraph to the largest size any run states —
/// which is what this did — measures every word of a long body at the size of one stray character
/// and breaks each line early. Measured on a probe round-tripped through LibreOffice's own
/// flat-ODS export: a body at <c>sz="1100"</c> followed by an unsized space wraps in the same
/// place as the same body alone, and a run stating <c>sz="1800"</c> after it leaves the body's own

/// character property is applied and then undone. The paragraph is therefore flattened to text
/// with a per-character format beside it, wrapped as one string, and each line then cut back into
/// the maximal stretches that share a format.
/// </para>

/// <strong>Wrapping is by whole words.</strong> That is what <c>wrap="square"</c> means and what

/// own characters, and LibreOffice never sees it as a character: every importer hands its string
/// to the EditEngine, and <c>ImpEditEngine::ImpInsertText</c> normalises the line ends to LF
/// (<c>convertLineEnd</c>), walks the string from separator to separator and calls
