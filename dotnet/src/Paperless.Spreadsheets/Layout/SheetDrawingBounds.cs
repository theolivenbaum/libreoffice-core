/// <strong>Two questions about a drawing decide pages, and both want the same rectangle.</strong>
/// <c>ScDrawLayer::GetPrintArea</c> widens the printed block to cover every object
/// (<c>sc/source/core/data/drwlayer.cxx:1400-1424</c>) and <c>ScDocument::HasAnyDraw</c> keeps a
/// page an object overlaps (<c>documen9.cxx:382-404</c>); both ask <c>GetCurrentBoundRect</c>, so
/// they are one computation with two callers — see <see cref="SheetDrawingArea"/> and
/// <see cref="SheetEmptyPages"/>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The bounding rectangle is not the anchor.</strong> A drawing's anchor states the frame
/// its shapes are laid out in; its bound rect is the union of what those shapes actually cover,
/// and a <em>turned</em> shape covers more than its own box. The distinction is invisible on a
/// plain picture and decides four pages on <c>SIL_TDB648.xlsx</c>, whose ten sheets each carry a
/// group of seven watermark pictures turned 27°: the union of their turned boxes reaches
/// <strong>4.2% further down</strong> than the group's frame and stops <strong>1.1% short</strong>
/// of its right edge. Reading the frame instead put the print area one band of rows too shallow on
/// two sheets — LibreOffice prints a blank fifth band of <c>TerrDB Verification</c> and a fourth of
/// <c>RAAS</c>, four pages we did not — and one column too wide on a third, where we printed three
/// blank pages of <c>RUNWAYS</c> that LibreOffice drops. Checked against LibreOffice's own answer
/// by exporting the workbook to flat ODF and reading the <c>table:end-cell-address</c> it wrote for
/// each group: <strong>10 of 10 columns and 9 of 10 rows exact</strong>, the tenth one row out.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The turn has to be applied after the group is resized, not before.</strong> A group
/// stretched to an anchor scales its children by different factors horizontally and vertically, and
/// the bounding box of a turned rectangle is not linear in those factors — scaling the box and then
/// turning it gives a different answer from turning it and then scaling. Measured on the same
/// workbook: the wrong order makes each watermark 197 pt tall where the reference draws it 255, and
/// the right order gives 252. That is why <see cref="SheetDrawing.Parts"/> carries the shapes rather
/// than a fixed inset the reader could have folded away.
