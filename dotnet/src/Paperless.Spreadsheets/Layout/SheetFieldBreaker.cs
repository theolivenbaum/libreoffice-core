/// A hyperlink cell is not a string cell. Calc's OOXML import replaces the cell with an edit
/// cell holding a single <c>SvxURLField</c> (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/worksheethelper.cxx:1062</c>,
/// <c>insertHyperlink</c>), and the BIFF import does the same. The content node's string is then
/// **one** <c>EE_FEATURE_FIELD</c> character; the URL a reader sees is the field's
/// *representation*, which the node does not contain.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That is what decides the breaking, because <c>ImpEditEngine::ImpBreakLine</c> hands the
/// <em>node's</em> string to the break iterator
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx:2080-2083</c>). A one-character node offers no
/// interior opportunity at all, so the iterator returns nothing usable and EditEngine falls
/// through to <c>// No separator in line =&gt; Chop!</c> (<c>impedit3.cxx:2236-2247</c>), cutting
/// at <c>nMaxBreakPos</c> — the last character position still under the remaining width.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So a field is <em>atomic to the breaker and still divisible by the chop</em>, and the two
/// halves of that are separately observable. Measured against the installed 26.2.4.2 on
/// <c>dotnet/probes/sheets-wrap-01</c>, six wrap-enabled cells in one 30-character column, the
/// same three strings once plain and once hyperlinked:

/// Row height is the one place a field really is unbreakable, and it is not a contradiction:

/// plain URL and 0.1756 in (one line) for the hyperlinked one, and the row then simply lets the
/// wrapped field overflow it — the reference PDF draws all three lines of a field in a
/// one-line-tall row. See the note in <see cref="SheetOptimalRowHeights"/>, which keeps its own
/// single-line rule for exactly that reason.
