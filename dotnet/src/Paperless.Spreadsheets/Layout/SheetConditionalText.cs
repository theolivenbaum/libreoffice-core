/// A differential record rather than a whole <see cref="SheetCellFormat"/>, because that is the

/// holds only the properties the rule overrides, and Calc turns each one into a cell
/// <em>style</em> whose item set holds exactly those items; everything the style is silent about
/// falls through to the cell's own pattern. So a rule that states a colour and nothing else must
/// leave the size, the face and the weight alone, and a null here is that silence.

/// <strong>One rule wins outright — the attributes of two matching rules are not merged.</strong>
/// <c>ScDocument::GetCondResult</c> (<c>sc/source/core/data/documen4.cxx</c>) walks the formats a
/// cell is covered by, asks each for a style name, and returns the <em>first</em> non-empty one's
/// item set; <c>ScConditionalFormat::GetCellStyle</c> (<c>conditio.cxx</c>) likewise returns the
/// first matching entry's style within a format. A reader that unioned two rules' properties
/// would paint combinations the reference never draws.
