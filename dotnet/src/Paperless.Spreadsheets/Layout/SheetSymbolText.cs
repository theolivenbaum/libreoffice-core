/// StarSymbol and the requested name differs from it
/// (<c>vcl/source/font/fontcache.cxx</c>:165-169), and <c>OutputDevice::ImplLayout</c> then
/// rewrites every string drawn through that instance
/// (<c>vcl/source/outdev/text.cxx</c>:1157-1158). Nothing about that is specific to Writer or
/// Impress, so a Calc cell set in <c>Symbol</c> is recoded on exactly the same terms — and
/// without this the cell asks OpenSymbol for a code point it does not hold, which is
/// <c>.notdef</c>, and glyph fallback then draws the character in DejaVu Sans instead of the
