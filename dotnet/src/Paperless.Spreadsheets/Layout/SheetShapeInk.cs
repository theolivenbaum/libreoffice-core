/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A worksheet shape's fill and outline were read in no format at all, and no gate column
/// can see one.</strong> A fill adds no glyphs and no pages, so a page-count-and-text harness
/// scores a sheet of blank stars exactly as it scores a sheet of coloured ones — the
/// <c>w:pgBorders</c> shape again. Censused whole-corpus over the <c>xlsx</c> family,
/// <b>644 <c>xdr:sp</c> in 49 documents</b>: 421 state an <c>a:solidFill</c> of their own, 205 an
/// <c>a:ln/a:solidFill</c>, and 583 an <c>xdr:style</c> naming the theme's format matrix.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The outline is the preset's, not the anchor's box.</strong> Those 644 shapes name 28
/// distinct presets and only 206 of them are <c>rect</c>, so painting the box fills a rectangle
/// where the file states a star, a heart or a cloud. <see cref="CustomShapeGeometry"/> resolves
/// all of them, and its two outlines are used rather than one: a subpath states whether it is
/// filled and whether it is stroked, so every connector — one open subpath declaring
/// <c>fill="none"</c> — would otherwise be painted as a solid blob, and the shading faces of
/// <c>cube</c>, <c>can</c> and <c>bevel</c> would be ruled into a wireframe.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>It is painted under the shape's own text and over the cells.</strong> Calc prints the
/// back drawing layer, the cell backgrounds, the strings, the grid and only then
/// <c>PrintDrawingLayer(SC_LAYER_FRONT)</c> (<c>sc/source/ui/view/printfun.cxx</c>:1651-1703), so a
/// filled shape covers the cells it sits on; <see cref="SheetPageGraphics"/> already draws after
/// the strings for that reason, and the text goes on last inside this shape's own box.
