/// A ruled-off row of blank cells prints, and a workbook of forms is mostly that. Calc reaches it

/// column holding <em>data</em>, and then runs the loop again headed <c>// Test attribute</c>
/// asking each column for its last <em>visible</em> attribute
/// (<c>sc/source/core/data/table1.cxx:710-724</c>). A cell counts as visibly attributed when it
/// states a background that is not transparent, any of the four border edges, a diagonal or a
/// shadow — <c>ScPatternAttr::CalcVisible</c> (<c>patattr.cxx:1584-1612</c>), which is the same

/// <para>
/// <strong>The scan has to stop, and where it stops is the whole difficulty.</strong> Formatting
/// runs to the end of the sheet far more often than data does — a column style, a banded fill, a
/// default cell style — so a scan that simply took the furthest formatted cell would put the print
/// area at row 1048576 on ordinary workbooks. Calc's rule is <c>SC_VISATTR_STOP</c>: below the last
/// row holding data, attribute runs are followed only while each run of visually equal rows is
/// shorter than <strong>84</strong> rows, and the first run that long ends the scan
/// (<c>ScAttrArray::GetLastVisibleAttr</c>, <c>attarray.cxx:1922-1975</c>, and its <c>#i30830#</c>
/// note). Eighty-four is two default pages' worth and the comment says as much: "as good as any
/// number".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A whole-column format is not exempt from the scan, and reading it as exempt cost a
/// page.</strong> The reasoning that used to stand here was that a run of columns, a row style or
/// the sheet default covers every row to the sheet's end, so it is one run far longer than
/// eighty-four and the first thing the scan stops at. That is true only while nothing
/// <em>splits</em> it. A single <c>&lt;row&gt;</c> with <c>customFormat</c> cuts the column's
/// attribute array in three, and the piece above the split is then a short, visible run that the
/// scan takes. Measured on <c>CSJU List of Recipients of funds 2013-2020.xlsx</c>, whose columns
/// E and F carry a solid white <c>&lt;col style&gt;</c> and whose row 13 states a format: Calc's
/// print area reaches F, ours reached D, and the two extra columns are 21724 twips against 19615
/// — enough that the fit-to-width search settles on 46% where we settled on 52%, which is nine
/// pages against eight.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What bounds the scan sideways is not the formatting but which columns exist.</strong>
/// <c>ScTable::GetPrintArea</c> loops <c>for (i = 0; i &lt; aCol.size(); i++)</c>, and
/// <c>aCol</c> holds only the columns that have been <em>allocated</em>. A format applied to a
/// range that reaches the sheet's last column allocates nothing: <c>ScTable::ApplyPatternArea</c>
/// takes <c>maxCol = max(nStartCol, aCol.size()) - 1</c> and writes the rest into
/// <c>aDefaultColData</c> (<c>sc/source/core/data/table2.cxx:2988-2998</c>). So the closing
/// <c>&lt;col min="7" max="16384"&gt;</c> that Excel writes on nearly every sheet materialises no
/// column at all, while <c>&lt;col min="6" max="6"&gt;</c> materialises one — which is why the
/// same workbook stops at F and not at XFD. That is reproduced here as
/// <see cref="AllocatedLastColumn"/>, and it is what keeps a whole-column fill from widening
/// every sheet that states one by sixteen thousand columns.
/// </para>

/// measured on <c>Computer and Software Services_50 State Comparison.xlsx</c>, whose columns I
