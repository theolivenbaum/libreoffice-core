/// Calc has no hatched cell background, so it mixes the pattern colour into the background at a
/// weight the pattern <em>number</em> decides and stores the single result.
/// <c>XclTools::GetPatternColor</c> (<c>sc/source/filter/excel/xltools.cxx</c>:347-358) indexes a
/// nineteen-entry table by the pattern and hands it to <c>ScfTools::GetMixedColor</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/filter/ftools/ftools.cxx</c>:118-130), which is
/// <c>(background − pattern) × ratio / 0x80 + pattern</c> per component in integer arithmetic.

/// <strong>The ratio runs the other way from SpreadsheetML's.</strong> There <c>alpha</c> is how
/// much of the pattern colour shows and <c>solid</c> is <c>0x80</c>; here <c>0x00</c> is the full
/// pattern colour and <c>0x80</c> the full background, which is why <c>solid</c> is index 1 with
/// ratio <c>0x00</c>. The two tables are not each other's complement either — BIFF's 12.5 %
/// grey is <c>0x70</c> where SpreadsheetML's <c>gray125</c> is <c>0x10</c>, which is the same
/// thing said twice — so neither can be derived from the other and both are transcribed.

/// Both BIFF readers used to take one of the two colours whole: <c>XlsDecorationTable.FormatOf</c>
/// the background for anything but <c>solid</c>, and <c>XlsConditionalFormats.ReadAreaBlock</c> the
/// foreground. Measured on <c>PC1000.xls</c>, whose 82 cells state pattern <c>0x11</c> — 12.5 %
/// grey, black over white — 26.2.4.2's own <c>--convert-to fods</c> gives their cell style
