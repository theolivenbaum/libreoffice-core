/// The Escher (MS-ODRAW) byte stream arrives split across every <c>MSODRAWING</c> record in the
/// substream — the split is arbitrary and a container routinely straddles it — so the payloads are
/// concatenated into one buffer and walked once at the end. <c>OBJ</c> records carry what Excel
/// knows about a shape that Escher does not (its type and identifier), and <c>TXO</c> plus its
/// <c>CONTINUE</c> records carry a text box's string. This is
/// <c>XclImpDrawing::ReadMsoDrawing</c> (<c>sc/source/filter/excel/xiescher.cxx:4021</c>)
/// assembling <c>maDffStrm</c>, <c>maRawObjs</c> and <c>maTextMap</c>, and it has to be done that
/// way: reading the <c>MSODRAWING</c> records one at a time yields truncated containers.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A shape is matched to its <c>OBJ</c> by position in the assembled stream.</strong> Each
/// <c>OBJ</c> follows the <c>MSODRAWING</c> records that carry its shape, so noting how many
/// drawing bytes had arrived when it was read gives an offset that falls inside that shape's
/// container and after every earlier one. LibreOffice keys <c>maObjMap</c> on exactly that
/// (<c>xiescher.cxx:4058</c>, <c>FindDrawObj</c>) and finds the shape by upper bound; the same
/// walk is done here from the shape side, which needs no map.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A shape's fill and outline are read, and three object kinds must not take them.</strong>
/// Calc builds its own <c>SdrObject</c> for a chart, a form control and an OLE object — the three

/// 2954) — and the replacement is not the object the Escher attributes were applied to, so the
/// fill and the line are dropped with it. Measured at the reference on
/// <c>TICAPCapability_Final.xls</c> and <c>014_Contextures_chart_sample</c>: their <c>Chart 1</c>,
/// <c>OptionButton1</c> and <c>Picture 228</c> all state a fill colour and all come back from
/// 26.2.4.2's own flat ODF as <c>draw:fill="none" draw:stroke="none"</c>, while the text boxes
/// beside them come back filled and stroked. See <see cref="EscherInk"/>.

/// <para>
/// <strong>A picture is named by a <c>pib</c> and stored in the workbook, not in the sheet.</strong>
/// The blip store lives once in the globals' <c>MSODRAWINGGROUP</c> and every sheet's shapes index
