/// (<c>:526-713</c>) takes a type byte, an operator byte, the byte lengths of two RPN formulas, a

/// records, so a reader that stops at the header cannot move a pixel whatever the corpus holds.
/// Asked of 26.2.4.2 instead, <c>--convert-to fods</c> resolves <strong>149 conditional formats

/// genuinely BIFF's is the operator table (<c>EXC_CF_CMP_*</c>,
