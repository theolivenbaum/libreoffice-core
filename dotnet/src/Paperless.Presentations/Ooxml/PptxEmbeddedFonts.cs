/// <para>
/// A deck that embeds a face is precisely the deck where resolving by name gives the wrong
/// metrics: the author had the face installed and we do not, so every advance width, every line
/// break and every block height is measured against a stand-in. On
/// <c>Ramp Up Campaign - French.pptx</c> that stand-in was DejaVu Sans for Alegreya Sans, which
/// is wider — every block gained a line, five overprinted one another, and the last paragraph
/// was pushed off the slide edge. The gate saw only the 19 words that went with it, three steps
/// downstream of the cause.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Keyed on the <c>typeface</c> the entry declares, not on the family name inside the
/// face.</strong> The two disagree, and the run names the former: this deck embeds a face whose
/// own family is <c>Alegreya Sans</c> and declares it as <c>Alegreya Sans Regular Bold</c>, which
/// is what 54 runs ask for. LibreOffice arrives at the same answer from the other end — it
/// registers the face under its typographic family and then converts the legacy full name on the
/// run into that family (tdf#172647, <c>EmbeddedFontsManager::addEmbeddedFont</c>) — and the
/// observable result is the same face on the same runs, which is what the reference PDF shows:
/// <c>AlegreyaSans-Medium</c>, <c>AlegreyaSans-Bold</c> and <c>AlegreyaSans-ExtraBold</c>.
/// Matching on the declared name reproduces that without owning a legacy-name table.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Read lazily and decoded lazily, separately. A deck with an embedded font list pays for the
/// list when its first run asks for a face, and pays for a 260 KB part only if a run actually
/// names that entry — this deck embeds seven faces and draws with three.
