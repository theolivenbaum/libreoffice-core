/// a LibreOffice type through <c>presetgeometrynames.cxx</c>, converts each adjustment guide from a
/// per-mille or a 1/60000 degree into WordArt's units, and derives <c>ScaleX</c> from the preset's
/// name. ODF states all three outright: <c>draw:type="fontwork-arch-up-curve"</c> is the type
/// <see cref="FontworkPresets"/> is keyed by, <c>draw:modifiers</c> is already in the 21600 viewbox

/// <c>draw:text-path-same-letter-heights</c> become the four members of the <c>TextPath</c>

/// it only when true, and it is true on nothing this project has measured — not in the corpus,
