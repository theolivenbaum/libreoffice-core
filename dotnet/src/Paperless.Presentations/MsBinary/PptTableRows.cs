/// A <c>.ppt</c> writes a table as a group of rectangles and lines, and the reference throws the
/// group away: <c>CreateTable</c> (<c>filter/source/msfilter/svdfppt.cxx</c>:7569) builds one
/// <c>SdrTableObj</c> whose rows are <em>seeded</em> from the members' snap-rect tops —
/// <c>CreateTableRows</c> at :7339, the last row's height measured to the group's own bottom —
/// and then re-laid out by <c>TableLayouter::LayoutTableHeight</c>
/// (<c>svx/source/table/tablelayouter.cxx</c>:724). That takes <c>max(stated, minimum)</c> per
/// row, where the minimum is the tallest single-row cell's own
/// <c>Cell::getMinimumHeight</c> (<c>svx/source/table/cell.cxx</c>:686) — its text measured at the
/// cell's inner width, <b>plus one unit</b>, plus the cell's upper and lower text distances — and
/// a cell spanning rows only ever grows its <em>last</em> row.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the group's own rectangles are a lower bound on the reference's rows and never the answer.
/// On <c>Thailand17.ppt</c> page 11 the rectangles are a 38.75 pt header and eight rows of 35.87;
/// the reference draws <b>39.20 and eight of 36.20</b>, 0.33 pt per row and cumulative.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two things the reference does here are not what they look like.</strong> The rows are
/// <em>sized</em> from the first member's top but <em>positioned</em> from the group's snap top,
/// because <c>CreateTable</c> hands the table object the group's rectangle
/// (<c>svdfppt.cxx</c>:7712) and the layouter lays out inside it; and the deferred minimum of a
/// row-spanning cell has the rows it covers subtracted from it only when the span does
/// <em>not</em> start at row 0 — <c>(nMRow &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; (nMRow &lt; nRow)</c> fails on its
/// first evaluation and the whole loop is skipped (<c>tablelayouter.cxx</c>:830). Both are
