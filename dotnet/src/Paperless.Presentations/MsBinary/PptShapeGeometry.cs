/// <para>
/// The binary format names a shape by a number (<c>MSO_SPT</c>,
/// <c>include/svx/msdffdef.hxx:276</c>) where DrawingML names it by a string, and the two
/// vocabularies describe the <em>same</em> two hundred shapes — LibreOffice runs both through one
/// table (<c>svx/source/customshapes/EnhancedCustomShapeGeometry.cxx</c>). So the bridge is a
/// lookup rather than a second geometry engine, and it covers every type naming a preset the
/// DrawingML evaluator knows; everything else falls back to its bounding rectangle, which is where
/// the shape is, in the right colour, with the wrong outline.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>An adjustment value is in a different unit in each vocabulary.</strong> The binary
/// form states it in a 21600-unit view box; DrawingML states it in hundred-thousandths. Feeding
/// one to the other unconverted makes a rounded rectangle either perfectly square or a stadium,
/// with nothing in between to notice.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>And the conversion is only sound where the two forms measure the same thing.</strong>
/// A scale factor is not a translation: DrawingML's adjustments per preset are defined against
/// that preset's own guides, and the binary vocabulary's are defined against
/// <c>EnhancedCustomShapeGeometry</c>'s handles for the corresponding <c>MSO_SPT</c>, which for
/// most shapes are neither the same quantity nor the same count. So a converted value is passed
/// only for the presets where the two definitions were <em>measured</em> to coincide, and every
/// other preset is drawn at its stated defaults — a right arrow with a default head is right in
/// outline and slightly wrong in proportion, where a right arrow fed a foreign adjustment is
/// neither.
