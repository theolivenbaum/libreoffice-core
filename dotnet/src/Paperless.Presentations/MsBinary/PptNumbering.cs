/// property of the run of paragraphs it sits in — where the run starts, what breaks it, and how a
/// nested level restarts when its parent advances — and that is the same question in a
/// <c>.pptx</c>, a <c>.ppt</c> and a diagram. <c>DrawingTextBody.AutoNumber</c> already answers it
/// and says in its own remarks that it is public so a second walk cannot drift from it; this maps
/// PowerPoint's scheme <em>number</em> onto the <c>ST_TextAutonumberScheme</c> <em>name</em> that
/// function takes, and hands the counters straight through.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The mapping is <c>PPTNumberFormatCreator::ImplGetExtNumberFormat</c>'s switch,
/// <c>filter/source/msfilter/svdfppt.cxx:3466-3630</c>, read as the alphabet-plus-punctuation pair
/// it is: scheme 8 is a lower-case letter in parentheses, which DrawingML spells
/// <c>alphaLcParenBoth</c>, and scheme 7 is an upper-case roman numeral with a full stop, which it
/// spells <c>romanUcPeriod</c>. The schemes LibreOffice leaves to a CJK, Hebrew or full-width
/// numbering type are not mapped: DrawingML has no name for them either, and inventing one would
/// draw a Latin number where the reference draws a Chinese one — they fall to
/// <see cref="Unmapped"/>, which draws no marker at all rather than the wrong one.
