/// <para>
/// <strong>A literal colour is the rare case, not the common one.</strong> The top byte decides
/// how the other three are read, and reading only the literal form — which is what this tree did
/// until round 92 — resolves <strong>14 of the 106</strong> fill and line colours the corpus's
/// 64 <c>.xls</c> state on a worksheet shape. The other 92 are palette indices, so a reader that
/// insists on the literal form draws no fill and no outline on nearly every legacy worksheet
/// shape there is. <c>probes/sheet-shapefill-r92/msoclr-census.txt</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is <c>SvxMSDffManager::MSO_CLR_ToColor</c>
/// (<c>filter/source/msfilter/msdffimp.cxx</c>:3420-3641), whose branches are, in order: a
/// <c>0xfe</c> header, which PowerPoint uses for text and which means "the low three bytes are
/// the colour"; the scheme and system forms, selected together by <c>nUpper &amp; 0x19</c>; a
/// second scheme form for a bare <c>nUpper &amp; 4</c> with no low bits; and, failing all of
/// those, a literal <c>0x00BBGGRR</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The palette is the host's and cannot be reached from here</strong> — Excel's is the
/// workbook's <c>PALETTE</c> record over the BIFF8 defaults, PowerPoint's the slide's colour
/// scheme — so it arrives as a callback. A host that has none passes null and every scheme
/// reference falls back, which is what <c>SvxMSDffManager::GetColorFromPalette</c>'s own base
/// implementation does (<c>:3388</c>, it answers false).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The system-colour branch is deliberately not implemented.</strong> It is twenty
/// desktop-theme colours and six recursive "use this shape's other colour" forms, and its answer
/// depends on the machine's widget theme rather than on the file — the reference reads
/// <c>Application::GetSettings()</c> for it. No worksheet shape in the corpus states one
/// (measured: zero of 106), so it falls back with everything else rather than inventing a theme.
