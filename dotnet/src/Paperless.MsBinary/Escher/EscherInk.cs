/// and <c>lineWidth</c> (459), with <c>fLine</c> (508) deciding whether there is an outline at
/// all. Nothing in this tree read any of them until round 84 — a worksheet shape's fill was
/// unread in all three of its formats — and the <c>.xls</c> half of that reaches this file.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Round 84's two conservative choices were both wrong, and together they read almost
/// nothing.</strong> They were <em>presence is the test</em> — a colour is taken only where the
/// shape states one, although MS-ODRAW defaults <c>fillColor</c> to white and <c>lineColor</c> to
/// black — and <em>only the literal <c>MSO_CLR</c> form is honoured</em>. Measured over the 64
/// corpus <c>.xls</c>: <strong>92 of the 106</strong> stated fill and line colours are palette
/// references rather than literals, and shapes stating <c>fLine</c> true with no <c>lineColor</c>
/// are a class of their own. On <c>TICAPCapability_Final.xls</c> the two <c>Instructions</c> text
/// boxes state <c>fillColor 0x08000041</c> and <c>lineColor 0x08000040</c> — palette 65 and 64,
/// which are Excel's <em>window background</em> and <em>window text</em>, so white and black —
/// and the reference draws a white panel with a 0.42 pt black border where this drew nothing at
/// all. <see cref="EscherColour"/> resolves the reference, and the two defaults are taken.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Whether there is a fill at all is a property of the shape <em>type</em> when the shape
/// does not say.</strong> <c>DffPropertyReader::ApplyFillAttributes</c>
/// (<c>filter/source/msfilter/msdffimp.cxx</c>:1313-1323) starts from the format's own default —
/// <c>mso_PropSetDefaults</c> gives property 447 the value <c>0x001C</c> and 511 the value
/// <c>0x001E</c>, so <em>both</em> <c>fFilled</c> and <c>fLine</c> default true
/// (<c>filter/source/msfilter/dffpropset.cxx</c>) — and then clears the bit again unless the
/// shape stated it <em>hard</em> or the type is filled (stroked) by default. So an unstated
/// boolean is the type's answer, not a constant: <c>mso_DefaultFillingTable</c> and
/// <c>mso_DefaultStrokingTable</c> (<c>svx/source/customshapes/EnhancedCustomShapeGeometry.cxx</c>:6156-6213)
/// are the tables, and they matter here because a picture frame is neither filled nor stroked by
/// default while a text box and a rectangle are both.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A stated boolean is honoured either way</strong>, which the corpus needs in both
/// directions: 216 of its worksheet shapes state property 511 as <c>0x00080000</c> — <c>fLine</c>
/// hard, and false — and 52 state 447 as <c>0x00100010</c>, which is <c>fFilled</c> hard and true.
