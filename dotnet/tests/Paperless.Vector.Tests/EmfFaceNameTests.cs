/// <c>lfFaceName</c> is a fixed 32-code-unit field and the name ends at its first NUL. Whether
/// the rest of the field is zeroed is the producer's business, and plenty do not zero it: the
/// EMF chart in <c>2014BSA_Sunday_Killion.pptx</c> writes <c>Times New Roman\0\0</c> and then
/// twelve code units of stack rubbish (<c>7f 13 65 43 18 ee a8 08 …</c>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A reader that <em>skips</em> the NULs rather than stopping at one asks for the concatenation,
/// which no substitution table recognises, so it falls through to the generic sans — and every
/// label of that chart came out in the wrong face at the wrong widths. It had been invisible for
/// thirty rounds because a wrong face and a right face both drew upright; it surfaced only when
/// this stack learned to synthesise an oblique, at which point the wrong face, having no italic,
/// began to lean where the reference does not.
