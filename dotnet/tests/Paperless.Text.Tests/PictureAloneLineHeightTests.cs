/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Writer builds a line's descent from the portions that carry text, and a fly-in-content is not one
/// of them, so a picture alone on its line has nothing hanging below its baseline. The paragraph
/// font still <em>floors</em> the line wherever a run exists — an empty paragraph is one line of its
/// own font tall — which is why only the descent is dropped and not the whole fallback.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured against the installed 24.2.7.2 by <c>dotnet/probes/words-r46/picture-alone-descent.py</c>,
/// sixteen rows over two formats, two shapes and four picture heights, reported as the gap between
/// the baseline above the picture's paragraph and the baseline below it. In a 12 pt Liberation Serif
/// document, a DOCX picture alone on its line at 20, 50 and 150 pt gives 33.80, 63.80 and 163.80,
/// and the same file with any text beside the picture gives 36.40, 66.40 and 166.40 — 2.60 pt more,
/// which is that font's descent to the tenth. At 5 pt both come back 27.60, the floor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This is round 45's open item, which could not be acted on because
/// <see cref="InlineObject.Height"/>'s remarks cite an ODF fixture where LibreOffice <em>does</em>
/// add that descent. It does, and it is not a format difference:
/// <c>dotnet/tests/corpus/features/picture-anchor.fodt</c> reads "An inline picture follows:
/// &lt;picture&gt; and that was it", so its picture has text on its line and it is the with-text row.
/// The probe authors both shapes in both formats to settle it and LibreOffice's fodt and docx agree
/// to 0.00 pt in all eight pairs.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two readers' shapes both appear below because they differ: DOCX and DOC emit an anchor
/// character for an inline picture and RTF and ODF emit nothing, so the same paragraph arrives as a
/// one-control-character line from one reader and as an empty line from another.
