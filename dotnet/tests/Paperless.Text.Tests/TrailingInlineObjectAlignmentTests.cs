/// An inline object is a <em>boundary</em> in the prefix table: it widens every prefix past the
/// position it occupies and none at or before it. That is right everywhere except at the end of the
/// text, where the range that would have paid for it does not exist — and a paragraph whose whole
/// content is a logo is exactly that shape, because ODF, RTF and WW8 put no character in the text
/// where a picture stands. Only OOXML does, which is why the defect was invisible in a DOCX.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on one right-aligned picture-only paragraph, 145.5 pt wide on a text area running to
/// 540 pt, written five ways by LibreOffice 26.2.4.2: its own PDFs put the picture's left edge at
/// 394.55, 394.55, 394.60, 394.60 and 394.55 for the <c>.docx</c>, <c>.odt</c>, <c>.doc</c>,
/// <c>.rtf</c> and <c>.fodt</c>; ours gave 394.50 from the <c>.docx</c> and <b>540.00</b> from the
/// other four — the picture's whole width out, drawn from the right margin rightwards, half of it
/// off the paper on a wide enough logo. <c>probes/words-aschar-band/</c>.
