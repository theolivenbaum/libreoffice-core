/// The property was resolved correctly through the style chain the whole time. What lost it is that
/// such a paragraph is <strong>uniform</strong>: every run has the style's formatting, so the run
/// splitter folds them away and the paragraph reaches the layout with no runs at all. Three
/// separate fallbacks then rebuild one run from the paragraph's own face, size, shaping and
/// tracking — and none of the three carried a width.
