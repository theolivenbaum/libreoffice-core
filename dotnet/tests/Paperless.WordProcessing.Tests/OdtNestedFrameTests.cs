/// <para>
/// An anchored object belongs to the <em>page</em> however deeply its anchor is nested — which is
/// why <c>FrameResolution</c> already walked the body's blocks, the running heads, the footnotes
/// and every table cell. What it did not walk was a placed frame's own content, on the reasoning
/// that the outer frame's rectangle has to exist first. It does — but it exists by the time the
/// outer frame has been placed, so the walk simply belongs after that loop rather than beside it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The failure was silent in the way a missing anchored object always is: the outer frame is drawn,
/// filled and stroked, and only the inner shape's text is absent. Measured on the converted corpus,
/// <b>six documents lose between 42 and 264 alphanumeric characters</b> to it, and on three of them
/// that loss is the document's whole shortfall against the reference to the character —
/// <c>020_Project_Timeline_Template_Modern_Theme</c> went from 109 of the reference's 316 to 316.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ground truth is 26.2.4.2's own PDF of the fixture, read with <c>pdftotext -bbox</c>: OUTER at
