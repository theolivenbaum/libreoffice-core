/// A Writer document's drawing shapes carry their text directly, and a group is one anchor.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A <c>draw:frame</c> keeps its text in a <c>draw:text-box</c> child and a
/// <c>draw:custom-shape</c> does not: ODF 1.3 §10.6.2 lets every shape element take
/// <c>&lt;text:p&gt;*</c> directly, which is what <c>SdrTextObj</c> hangs its outliner text on.
/// A reader that looks only for the box therefore draws every shape in the document empty, and
/// the failure is silent — the shape is still placed, filled and stroked, so nothing on the page
/// says a paragraph is missing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A <c>draw:g</c> is worse than empty: it states no <c>svg:width</c> and no <c>svg:height</c>,
/// so a reader that needs a size to place something drops the whole group. ODF gives a group no
/// coordinate system of its own — no <c>svg:viewBox</c>, no transform on the element — and
/// <c>xmloff</c> reads its children straight into the page's coordinates
/// (<c>xmloff/source/draw/ximpgrp.cxx</c>), so flattening the group to its shapes is the whole of
/// it. What the children do not restate is the placement: the group is the object anchored in the
/// text, and a child's graphic style is derived from the named <c>Frame</c> style, which says
/// <c>horizontal-pos="center"</c> and <c>vertical-pos="top"</c>. Letting that inherited default
/// win over the group's own <c>from-left</c> stacks every shape of the group at the top centre of
/// the page.
