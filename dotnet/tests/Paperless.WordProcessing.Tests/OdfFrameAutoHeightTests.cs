/// Both lengths are optional (ODF 1.3 §10.4.2) and Writer leaves the height off a frame that
/// grows to its content — a text box or a framed table after "autofit height". What it writes
/// instead is the floor, on the box: <c>&lt;draw:text-box fo:min-height="0in"&gt;</c>. Requiring
/// both lengths to place a frame therefore dropped the frame <em>and everything inside it</em>,
/// and said nothing: a page with no frame on it looks like a page whose author put none there.
/// </para>

/// Reach on the converted corpus: 49 of the 338 <c>.odt</c> hold 58 such frames carrying
/// <strong>50 942 alphanumeric characters</strong> between them, and in ten of those the frame is
/// the page — <c>020_Project_Timeline_Template_Modern_Theme</c> drew 0 characters against the
/// reference's 316, <c>part-147_approval list_20230119</c> 114 against 3570.

/// <para>
/// <strong>Growing the frame is a separate rule and it is now implemented</strong> — see
/// <see cref="OdtFrameGrowthTests"/> and <see cref="Layout.PageFrame.GrowsToContent"/>. It did not
/// need <c>FrameLayout</c>'s order inverted, which is what the round that placed the frame
/// supposed: <c>FrameLayout.Place</c> is a pure function of the frame's stated size and the page
/// and anchor geometry, and the content's own layout needs only the frame's <em>width</em>, which
/// the file states — so the height is measured in a pass that runs first.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This fixture is <em>not</em> a growth witness, and deliberately so: its <c>fr1</c> is an
/// automatic graphic style with no parent, which LibreOffice imports as a drawing shape rather
/// than as a Writer text frame (<c>xmloff/source/text/XMLTextFrameContext.cxx</c>:1374-1394,
/// <em>"#i51726#"</em>, and :1500-1507), and a shape fits itself to its text by a different rule.
/// What it pins is that such a frame is read and placed at all.
