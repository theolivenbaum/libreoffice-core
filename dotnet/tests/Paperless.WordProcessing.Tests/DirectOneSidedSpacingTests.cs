/// <para>
/// <c>DomainMapper_Impl.cxx</c>:3110-3138 — <em>"set paragraph top or bottom margin based on the
/// paragraph style if we already set the other margin with direct formatting"</em> — fires when the
/// paragraph's own <c>w:pPr</c> sets an unequal subset of {top margin, bottom margin, contextual
/// spacing}, and fills each unset margin <b>as direct formatting</b> from
/// <c>GetPropertyFromParaStyleSheet</c>. That walks the DOCX <c>w:basedOn</c> chain and then
/// <c>w:docDefaults</c> (<c>DomainMapper_Impl.cxx</c>:1556-1628); it never consults Writer's pool,
/// because the pool is a property of the Writer style rather than of the DOCX style sheet.
/// </para>

/// Every expectation is a measurement of the installed 26.2.4.2, from
/// <c>dotnet/probes/words-p1-01/direct-one-sided-spacing.py</c>, which authors each variant and reads
/// <c>fo:margin-top</c> / <c>fo:margin-bottom</c> straight out of <c>--convert-to fodt</c> — the
/// importer's own answer, before any layout, font or rounding beyond the hundredth of a millimetre
/// the format stores. The same script writes
/// <c>tests/corpus/features/direct-one-sided-spacing.docx</c>, so the fixture and these numbers come

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>That probe runs both declaration orders and the first version of it ran only one, which made it

/// fixture is child-first, which is the arrangement <c>FAA 2025-26 Holdover Tables.docx</c> has —

/// first note <b>3.00 pt</b> — the inherited 60 twips exactly — closer on those 31. Each of those
