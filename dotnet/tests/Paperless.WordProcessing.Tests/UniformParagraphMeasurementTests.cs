/// A paragraph whose formatting does not vary carries no runs, and the two layouters measured it by

/// fallback. The <em>drawing</em> pass has never had that shortcut: <c>PageDrawing.RunsIn</c> sends
/// every paragraph through <c>FontItemiser.Split</c> whether it has runs or not, and its own comment
/// says the cut is made "as the measurement cut them".
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// For a paragraph of Chinese in a Latin face that is false in the worst way. The drawing pass finds
/// a CJK face and draws an em per character; the measuring pass shapes every character to Liberation
/// Serif's <c>.notdef</c> and charges 1593 of 2048 units, 0.778 em. Measured on
/// <c>手机免提系统TSB.doc</c>: a line filled to 44 characters where 34 fit, 410.70 pt of measured
/// width painted as 528, running 6.8 pt past the edge of the page itself — and 179 of the document's
/// 1530 characters were pushed off the page and out of the extracted text altogether.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="GlyphFallbackWiringTests"/> already covers the split and never caught this, because it
/// asks <c>PageParagraph.Measure()</c> for the measurement directly — and <c>Measure()</c> was right
