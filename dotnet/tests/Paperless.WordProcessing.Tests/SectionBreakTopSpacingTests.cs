/// contrast this exists against: at <c>compatibilityMode</c> 15 a <c>w:br w:type="page"</c> and a
/// <c>w:pageBreakBefore</c> both drop the space, because <c>SwFrame::IsCollapseUpper</c>
/// (<c>sw/source/core/layout/calcmove.cxx</c>:1120) takes it back on every page but the first. A
/// section break is the carve-out that function states in its own comment — it declines "after
/// applying a new page style (but do it after page breaks)" — and
/// <c>SectionPropertyMap::CloseSectionGroup</c> gives every page-starting section a page style, so
/// the paragraph opening one carries a <c>RES_PAGEDESC</c> and keeps its space.

/// without a portrait-to-landscape change across the break, all carrying 20 pt of space-before over
/// 10 pt of space-after. The two explicit breaks track the mode, 91.4 pt at 12 and 81.4 pt at 15. A
/// <c>nextPage</c> break puts the line at 91.4 pt in <b>all eight</b>: neither the mode nor the

/// this restores is what stops its glossary table fitting one extra row on page four, which is what
/// carried its last row — and the repeated heading row above it — off page nine. It went from
