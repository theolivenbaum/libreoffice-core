/// A footnote that will not fit moves to the next page; the text citing it does not.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The paginator used to shorten a paragraph's line count until the notes those lines cited fitted too,
/// so a note that would not fit removed the very line that cited it. That is what made
/// <c>template---tpr-technical-progress-report-with-guidance.docx</c> render 8 pages against 7: its page
/// 2 cites a footnote from the third line of a bullet, charging that footnote left no room for the
/// bullet, and the <c>Heading2</c> above it — <c>keepNext</c>, <c>keepLines</c> — followed it forward.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The reference draws the superscript on page 2 at y=659.1 and the note's own text on page 3 at
/// y=675.3. Our page 2 stopped at y=576.2 with the footnote at y=708.2 — 132 pt of empty body where the
/// reference leaves 33.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Measured before implementing, because two rules produce that output.</strong> Writer might
/// move the note whole or split it, and on that document they are indistinguishable — the note area was
/// already filled by an earlier footnote, so a split would have left nothing behind either. A probe
/// citing a 60-word note from a controlled body depth
/// (<c>probes/footnote-deferral/footnote-deferral.py</c>) leaves <strong>49</strong> of the note's 59
/// words on the citing page at one body length and <strong>17</strong> at the next. That is a cut at the
/// room remaining; a whole move predicts nought or fifty-nine and never seventeen.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// What is implemented here is the boundary case of that rule — a note is carried whole rather than cut
/// at its last fitting line — because splitting needs a note to be layable from a line offset, which
/// nothing in the layouter can do yet. The corpus needs only the boundary: <c>tpr</c> closes at 7 pages
/// of 7 and <c>EHEST-SMS-Safety-Management-Manual-V2.docx</c> moves 80/82 to 81/82.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The probe's own remaining disagreement is recorded rather than papered over. We take <strong>13</strong>
/// pages there against the reference's 14, having taken 15 before, and the citing page agrees on six of
/// the ten cases outright. The three that still differ are exactly the ones the reference splits: we move
/// the note whole where it leaves 17 or 49 words behind. That is the other half of the work.
