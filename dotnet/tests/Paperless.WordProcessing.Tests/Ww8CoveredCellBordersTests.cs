/// [bin] The instrument that separates the two readings is 26.2.4.2's own <c>--convert-to fodt</c> of the

/// stating a 3 pt top over a covered cell stating <c>nil</c> gives the covered cell <b>3 pt</b>, and a
/// master stating 1 pt under a covered cell stating 3 pt gives it <b>1 pt</b> — the master's in both
/// directions and the cell's own in neither. The ODF export names it as plainly as the numbers do: the
/// covered cell comes out carrying the master's own cell style, <c>TableN.A1</c>, where an unmerged lower
