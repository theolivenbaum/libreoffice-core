/// <para>
/// <b>This is a control, and it exists because a previous round concluded the opposite.</b> Round
/// 124 (<c>probes/ink-hunt-r124</c> §7) read the line-break tables and argued that no such split
/// can ever happen: <c>U+0001</c>, the anchor character every word-processing reader puts where an
/// inline object sits, is UAX #14 <c>Line_Break=CM</c>, and LB9 forbids a break <em>before</em> a
/// combining mark — so two adjacent anchors are welded and the second object can never leave the
/// first object's line. The reading of the tables is correct; the conclusion is not.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>inline-object-pair.docx</c> holds two inline pictures 4.5 in wide in one paragraph whose
/// measure is 6.5 in, so the pair overflows and the second must move. This tree draws them at
/// <c>y</c> 72.0–153.0 and 153.0–234.0, and 26.2.4.2 draws them at the same two rectangles. A
/// second probe at the witness's own geometry — 6.5 in and 6.5 in — agrees as well: ours 72.0–258.6
/// and 258.6–471.0 against 71.9–258.5 and 258.6–471.0. The anchors never reach LB9 as a pair: a run
/// holding nothing but anchors goes through <c>MeasuredParagraph</c>'s own path, where an inline
/// object widens every prefix past its boundary and the object is pushed to the next line when
/// anything precedes it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the defect round 124 saw on <c>RMI_…GettingOffOil.doc</c> — two as-char pictures drawn on one
/// baseline, one over the other — is not this mechanism. See <c>probes/wordsgroup-r128/results.md</c>
/// §3, which seated it against the WW8 reader.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>And that seat is closed, by the <c>.doc</c> half of this pair.</b> The WW8 walk dropped the
/// anchor character of every frame it made, floating or as-character, so two adjacent inline pictures
/// arrived at the layout with <em>one</em> offset between them — and an inline object's offset is a
/// boundary, so there was nothing for the measurer to break at. <c>inline-object-pair.doc</c> is
/// 26.2.4.2's own DOC export of two 4.4 in pictures in one paragraph on a 6.925 in measure; at the base
/// of round 130 this tree drew them at <c>y</c> 84.9–171.3 and 70.5–171.3, sharing a bottom edge, and it
/// now draws 70.5–156.9 and 156.9–257.7 against the reference's 70.6–157.0 and 157.0–257.6.
