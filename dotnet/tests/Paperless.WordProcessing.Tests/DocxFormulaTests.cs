/// OMML is structural: a fraction is an <c>m:f</c> holding a numerator and a denominator and
/// nothing in the file says "draw a rule between them"; a radical is an <c>m:rad</c> and nothing
/// says <c>U+221A</c>; a delimiter pair states its brackets in <em>attributes</em> of
/// <c>m:dPr</c>. So a reader that emits the <c>m:t</c> leaves and nothing else draws <c>ab</c> for
/// a fraction and <c>i=1nxi</c> for a sum — which is what this tree did until the walk existed,
/// because <c>m:r</c> and <c>m:t</c> share their local names with <c>w:r</c> and <c>w:t</c> and the

/// <strong>Why the fixture is a ladder.</strong> Fifteen constructs, each stated twice — once
/// inline and once as display maths — so a regression names the construct it broke rather than
/// reporting that a page changed. Every arm was measured against 26.2.4.2's own rendering of the
/// same committed file before a line of the walk was written; the per-construct table is in
/// <c>probes/omml-r163/results.md</c>, where all fifteen failed.

/// <strong>What these assertions deliberately do not pin.</strong> The reference lays a formula out
/// in <em>two</em> dimensions — a stacked fraction, limits above and below an n-ary, a vinculum
/// over a radicand — and this walk puts every mark on one line in reading order. So the tests below
/// assert that the generated marks are <em>present and in the right order</em>, which is what the
/// one-dimensional rendering can honestly claim, and say nothing about where they sit. A later
/// round that adds a math box model should tighten them rather than delete them.
