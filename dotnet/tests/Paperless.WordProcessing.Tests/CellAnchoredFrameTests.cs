/// Writer draws no distinction between a cell and any other text frame: <c>SwTextFly</c> belongs to the
/// frame being formatted, and a fly overlapping it narrows its lines or pushes them below whatever the
/// frame is. This engine reached its obstacles by top-level block index, and a paragraph inside a cell
/// has none — so a frame anchored in a cell was placed, drawn, and an obstacle for nobody, its own
/// anchor paragraph included. The row then ended at its text height with the frame hanging out of it.

/// <para>
/// Measured on <c>absrc-pac-01-info-note-en.doc</c> (words/pagination-001), whose masthead is two logos
/// anchored in the two narrow cells of the banner table's first row. The wider logo is 64.8 pt in a
/// 68.45 pt cell, so neither side of it has room for text at all and the cell's empty anchor paragraph
/// belongs below it. Row one is 36.375 to 105.125 pt with that and 36.375 to 74.025 without; the
/// reference starts its second row at 104.5, and everything in the left column — the organisation's
/// logo, the <c>Distr.</c> block, the title — was 31.24 pt too high without it. With it the block's
