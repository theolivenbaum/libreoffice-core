/// shape a defect can have, because every geometric assertion still passes. A floating shape's
/// <c>pib</c> is a one-based index into the document's <c>OfficeArtBStoreContainer</c>. An
/// inline picture is an <c>OfficeArtInlineSpContainer</c> — the shape, then its <em>own</em>
/// <c>FBSE</c> — and its <c>pib</c> is numbered from one inside that container, so the same
/// small number appears on every inline picture in the file and collides with the store
/// whenever the document also has floating shapes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on the corpus: <c>150_5300_13_chg10.doc</c> has twenty-five inline pictures whose
/// <c>pib</c> runs 1 to 22 and a shared store of twelve entries, and four of its inline figures
/// were each drawn as the same 197 x 77 grayscale JPEG belonging to a floating shape elsewhere
/// in the document. LibreOffice reaches the right answer by a different route and says why in
/// the code: <c>SwWW8ImplReader::ImportGraf</c> calls <c>DisableFallbackStream()</c> before
/// importing an inline shape, "##835## ... testing for existence in main stream may lead to an
/// incorrect fallback graphic being found" (<c>sw/source/filter/ww8/ww8graf2.cxx:531-537</c>).

/// entry in the shared store — and one <em>inline</em> WMF cropped 10/20/30/40, and the inline
/// shape's <c>pib</c> is 1, which the store also answers. It is
/// <c>picture-blip-collision.docx</c> through <c>soffice --convert-to doc</c> and then patched
/// in place into the shape Word writes, the same two steps and the same reasoning as
/// <c>picture-crop-goal.doc</c>: a file round-tripped through the reference implementation is a
/// statement about the reference implementation, so the PICF crop is zeroed and the goal
/// shrunk to the visible extent before anything is asserted against it.
