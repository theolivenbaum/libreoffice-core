/// arithmetic has been in <c>Paperless.Core.Geometry.PictureCrop</c> and the property read in
/// <c>Paperless.MsBinary.Escher.EscherPicture</c> since the slide round; what was missing was the
/// plumbing, and the plumbing is not one call. A frame has no rectangle until <c>FrameLayout</c>
/// has placed it, so the fractions travel on <see cref="FramePicture.Crop"/> and
/// <see cref="PageFrame.Crop"/> and <c>PageDrawing</c> does the arithmetic where
/// <c>PlacedFrame.Area</c> exists.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The clip is new and is half the change.</b> <c>PageDrawing.DrawFrame</c> called
/// <c>DrawImage(image, frame.Area)</c> bare. Drawing into a larger rectangle without a clip does
/// not crop a picture — it puts the whole of it over the text on every side — so a round that
/// shipped only the rectangle would be a regression rather than a fix.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>There are three fixtures because a round trip cannot produce the file the corpus is made
/// of.</b> <c>picture-crop.docx</c> states <c>a:srcRect l="10000" t="20000" r="30000" b="40000"</c>
/// on an inline picture 288 × 216 pt; <c>picture-crop.doc</c> is that file through
/// <c>soffice --convert-to doc</c>, which is what turns the <c>a:srcRect</c> into Escher's 256–259
/// and puts the shape in the <c>Data</c> stream where an inline picture lives; and
/// <c>picture-crop-goal.doc</c> is that file patched into the shape Word writes. See the theory

/// <b>The <c>.docx</c> half reads <c>a:srcRect</c> too, and the three fixtures are the check on

/// <c>DocxPictures</c> into <see cref="FramePicture.Crop"/> and out through <c>DocxFrames</c> and
/// <c>DocxVmlFrames</c> onto the <see cref="PageFrame"/>, which is the same pair of hops the

/// turns <c>a:srcRect</c> into a <c>text::GraphicCrop</c> against the graphic's original size
/// (<c>fillproperties.cxx</c>:844-873) and the Escher reader produces the same property — so the
