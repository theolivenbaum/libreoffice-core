/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Rendering a diagram and extracting one are two different readings of the same five parts, and
/// making the first work does not make the second work: <c>IDocument</c> gives content and
/// <c>IPaginatedDocument.Layout()</c> is a distinct deferred step, so extraction reaches the data
/// model directly rather than through anything that needs a theme, a font or a frame extent. On
/// <c>024_Unit_Circle_Chart_Colorful_Circles</c> the whole deficit was the five nodes'
/// <c>YOUR TEXT</c> — the words were in the package the entire time and nothing asked for them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The two readings want different answers, which is why this is not "call the
/// renderer".</strong> The baked <c>dsp:spTree</c> is what the author sees, so it repeats a node's
/// text wherever the layout drew it and adds text the layout generated; the data model is what the
/// author typed, once each. <see cref="DocxDiagramPackage"/> makes the difference observable — its
/// model holds a third node the baked drawing never draws, and two points on types no reader sees.
