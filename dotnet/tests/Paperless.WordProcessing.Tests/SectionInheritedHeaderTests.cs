/// §17.10.1: a slot a <c>w:sectPr</c> does not name is inherited from the section before it, which is
/// what "link to previous" writes. <c>DocxReader.Furniture</c> implements that. The exception is stated
/// on <c>DocxReader.FurnitureCarry</c> and pinned by the shape variants in
/// <see cref="InheritedTableHeaderTests"/>; this file is the same rule on the corpus fixture that
/// produced it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture is the shape three corpus DOCX have. Its first section's header is a table with a cell
/// of title and a cell of revision and <strong>no paragraph outside the table</strong>; its second
/// section names an empty <c>even</c> and an empty <c>first</c> header, which is what Word writes into
/// slots the user never filled, and no default one. The document states neither
/// <c>w:evenAndOddHeaders</c> nor <c>w:titlePg</c>, so both named slots are inert and the only header in
/// play is the inherited one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>This file asserted the opposite until 2026-08-15, deliberately, and the reversal is the
/// point — so read why before turning it back.</strong> Round 43 established the mechanism from both
/// ends (<c>probes/words-r43/header-inherit-bisect.py</c> cuts the real document down until a bare
/// <c>&lt;w:p/&gt;</c> beside the header's table brings the running head back;
/// <c>header-inherit-content-shape.py</c> authors eight headers of which the only one not inherited is
/// the table with no paragraph beside it) and declined to reproduce it, under TODO.md's non-goal
/// "bug-for-bug reproduction of LibreOffice's own import defects". It is an import defect: LibreOffice
/// means to link — "should be 'linked' with the corresponding header or footer from the previous
/// section … so we just copy the content", <c>sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/PropertyMap.cxx</c> — and
/// the copy silently yields nothing when the source header holds no top-level paragraph. The same
/// header content <em>named</em> by a section's own reference draws perfectly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two things changed the accounting. First, round 43 measured against <strong>24.2.7.2</strong>, and
/// CLAUDE.md lists "the reference's own table-only-header import defect" among the claims that need one
/// re-check against 26.2.4.2 before being relied on. Re-measured on 26.2.4.2 with a fresh two-section
/// probe, the behaviour is unchanged, so the mechanism survives the version move intact. Second, and
/// this is what round 43 could not see, <strong>the cost was understated by a page</strong>: it recorded
/// the fix as gaining one verdict and improving <c>UG.CAO.00006</c>'s words "without moving its
/// verdict", where in fact the spurious running head was also costing that document a page —
/// <c>30/29</c> pages and 8001 words against 7399 before, <c>29/29</c> and 7390 against 7399 after. A
/// page count is check one of the gate, so this is not a word-column trade.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The rest of the cost stands as round 43 stated it and is not hidden here:
/// <c>probes/words-r43/table-only-header-census.py</c> finds 3 of the 134 corpus DOCX inheriting a
/// table-only header and can see none of the 66 <c>.doc</c>; the third,
/// <c>docs-quality-MA.IMS.00001 …</c>, has its word error made worse (11973 against 12213) and its
/// verdict is unmoved, because it fails on pages at 43/44 either way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A measurement trap worth keeping: this document's running head opens with "European Aviation Safety
/// Agency" and so does its <strong>footer</strong>, which prints on every page of both renderings. A
/// probe keyed on that phrase reports the head everywhere and closes the question in the wrong
/// direction. Key on "Approval Date", which appears in no footer.
