/// Writer's rule, stated twice in <c>SwFlowFrame::IsKeep</c>
/// (<c>sw/source/core/layout/flowfrm.cxx</c>:345): it reads the <em>next</em> content's items and
/// drops the keep for <c>if (pPageDesc->GetPageDesc()) bKeep = false;</c> and again for a
/// <c>PageBefore</c> or <c>PageBoth</c> break. The reasoning is the same in both cases — a successor
/// that cannot share this page is not something the paragraph can be kept with, so honouring the
/// keep only empties the bottom of the page.

/// The fixture is the shape that found it: three paragraphs, the last carrying <c>w:keepNext</c>, a

/// 26.2.4.2 renders two pages, the first holding all three paragraphs.

/// break. Bouncing that paragraph gave it a page of its own carrying a running head, a page number
/// and no text, and the document paginated to nine pages against the reference's eight.
