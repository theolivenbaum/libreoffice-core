/// <c>DomainMapper_Impl::ApplySettingsTable</c>
/// (<c>sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/DomainMapper_Impl.cxx:10173</c>) sets
/// <c>PrinterIndependentLayout::DISABLED</c> from it, the same state
/// <c>WW8Dop::fUsePrinterMetrics</c> puts a DOC into and which <c>DocReader</c> has honoured all
/// along.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two fixtures differ in that element and nothing else. Measured on the installed
/// <b>26.2.4.2</b>, the line pitch of 16 pt Arial — Liberation Sans after substitution — is
/// <b>18.450 pt</b> printer-independently and <b>18.250 pt</b> with the flag.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The size is not arbitrary and it had to be changed on 2026-08-15.</strong> The pair was
/// built at 12 pt, where a 300 dpi printer separated them by 0.15 pt; the printer on this
/// container is 600 dpi, which sets 12 pt at exactly 100 device pixels, so at that size the flag
/// changes <em>nothing</em> and this test asserted a difference the binary no longer makes. 16 pt
/// is the largest separation in a sweep of every half point from 8 to 16 — 4 twips, 0.20 pt — and
/// <c>probes/words-p1-01/remake-printer-metrics-docx.py</c> both rebuilds the pair and re-measures
/// it through <c>soffice</c>, because <em>which</em> size discriminates is a property of the
/// device rather than of the document and moves with it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Note that the printer pitch is the <em>shorter</em> one here, which the 12 pt case never showed.
/// The grid is a coarser quantisation and not a systematic enlargement: it moves in both
/// directions with size. A fixture that only ever saw it grow invited the wrong generalisation.
