/// <para>
/// The rule a reader cannot resolve. A note's number under a per-page restart is its position within its
/// page, the width of the citation follows from the number, and where the citing line breaks follows from
/// the width — so the answer depends on the pagination that depends on the answer. Writer settles it by
/// numbering over pages that already exist and then damping: <c>SwRootFrame::UpdateFootnoteNums</c>
/// (<c>ftnfrm.cxx</c>:971) walks the finished pages, and <c>txtftn.cxx</c>:560 validates the frame one
/// iteration later under the comment <em>"We break the oscillation"</em>. This engine does the same, in
/// <c>Layout/NoteRenumbering.cs</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>note-restart.*</c> is the ground truth and the corpus was built for it: two pages, eight footnotes,
/// four to a page, and all four formats keep the rule through LibreOffice's own export in four different
/// spellings — <c>text:start-numbering-at="page"</c>, <c>w:numRestart w:val="eachPage"</c>,
/// <c>\ftnrstpg</c> and the DOP's <c>rncFootnote</c>. All of them render page one citing 1, 2, 3, 4 and
/// page two citing 1, 2, 3, 4 again.

// [reference moved 24.2.7.2 -> 26.2.4.2, closed] `TheNumbersAreTheOnesLibreOfficeDraws` failed on
// `note-restart.docx` on four characters, and every one of them was `pdftotext -layout`'s own column
// padding: see `WithoutLayoutIndent` for the measurement. Nothing about the rendering differs.
