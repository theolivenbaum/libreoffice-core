/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <c>SlideChart</c> set every chart label in Liberation Sans for four rounds, on the evidence
/// that <c>pdffonts</c> reported Liberation Sans in LibreOffice's own PDF of
/// <c>chart-bar-deck.pptx</c>. That deck's chart states <c>&lt;a:latin typeface="Arial"/&gt;</c>
/// eleven times, and fontconfig substitutes Arial with Liberation Sans — so the measurement is
/// equally consistent with a fixed face and with the stated one, and the corpus cannot separate
/// them without also changing the theme, the sizes and the data at once.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// So the two decks here are that deck with <em>one</em> thing moved. Both set the theme's minor
/// Latin face to <strong>Liberation Mono</strong>, because a monospace is the widest available
/// separation from either proportional candidate and it moves the plot area's left edge as well
/// as the embedded font list. <c>chart-face-theme-minor.pptx</c> then states no <c>a:latin</c> at
/// all and <c>chart-face-stated.pptx</c> states a literal <c>Liberation Serif</c>. LibreOffice
/// 24.2.7.2 embeds LiberationMono in the first and LiberationSerif in the second, which is the
/// pattern only "the theme's minor face, overridden by a stated one" predicts: a fixed face gives
/// two identical answers, and reading only a stated face leaves the first on a fallback.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The face assertion alone would be a metadata test</strong>, and a face that is merely
/// named right moves no ink — the round-nineteen <c>/BaseFont</c> finding is exactly that shape.
/// So the third case measures <em>one digit's advance</em>, taken as the gap between the pen of
/// the value axis' three-digit labels and the pen of its two-digit ones. They are right-aligned
/// on the same edge, so that gap is one digit and nothing else: 6.01 pt in ten-point Liberation
/// Mono against 5.55 in Liberation Sans.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two more obvious quantities were measured first and both are the wrong thing to
/// assert.</strong> An absolute pen position carries the composition as well as the face: the
/// value axis' labels land 0.36 pt from the reference with this change and 0.96 pt without —
/// better — while the legend lands 2.49 pt out with it and 1.39 pt out without, because the
/// composition has a legend-reservation error of its own that the wrong face was partly
/// cancelling. And a word's ink width carries the two writers' show splitting: the reference
/// positions each digit of "100" separately, so poppler ends its box at the last glyph's ink and
/// reports 17.25 where our single show reports the full 18.03 advance. Neither difference is
/// about the face. The gap between two of the axis' own labels is.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
// [reference moved 24.2.7.2 -> 26.2.4.2, corrected] `TheThemesFaceDecidesTheValueLabelsAdvances`
// asserted that the *reference's* digit advance is the design metric, and under 26.2.4.2 it is not: the
// face is still Liberation Mono — `pdffonts` reports one font, `BAAAAA+LiberationMono`, and
// `AChartUnstatedTakesTheThemesMinorFace` still passes — but the reference draws its digits 5.839 pt
// apart against 24.2.7.2's 6.010 and the face's own 6.004. It is not about the face.
//
// [2026-09-06] **Found, and it was ours.** A chart's text is not laid out by Impress: `chart2`'s view
// builds it as plain text shapes on the `VirtualDevice` that `DrawModelWrapper` creates from
// `Application::GetDefaultDevice()` with `MapUnit::Map100thMM`
// (`chart2/source/view/main/DrawModelWrapper.cxx`:88-99), and that device is **96 dpi**
// (`SvpSalGraphics::GetResolution`, `vcl/headless/svpgdi.cxx`:44). An `OutputDevice` instantiates a
// font at a whole number of device pixels, so a 10 pt label is laid out at **13** pixels rather than
// 13.333 and every advance in it is 2.5% narrow — 5.85 pt against the face's 6.004. `SlideChart` drew
// the design metric; it now goes through `MetricGrid.Chart`, which is the rule `SheetBandText.ChartShape`
// has applied to a workbook's charts since round 62 and which the slides and words tracks were left out
// of. `probes/chart-text-metafile/` establishes it: the drawn advance follows `round(px96)/px96` over
// twelve sizes in **both** reference binaries, residual at most 0.003, while the same string in an
// ordinary slide text box on the same slide of the same deck stays within 0.7% of the design metric at
// every one of them.
//
// So the earlier reading of this file — that 24.2.7.2 "sat on the design metric" and only 26.2.4.2
// departed — was wrong, and the way it was wrong is worth keeping. 24.2.7.2 quantises the advance the
// same way; what it *also* does is snap each glyph position to a whole 96 dpi pixel, so its gaps are 7
// or 8 pixels where 26.2.4.2's are a flat 7.79, and it right-aligns these labels on their *design*
// widths while drawing them from the device's narrower array. That inconsistency is what made
// `pen("80") - pen("100")` read 6.010 there. 26.2.4.2 uses one width for both, which is why the same
// difference reads 5.839 — and why ours, which also uses one width for both, now reads 5.839 too.
//
// The `TJ` adjustment of 16 at every inter-glyph position is that scale expressed in thousandths of an
// em: 600 x (1 - 13/13.342) = 15.4. It is not the text-advance divergence `CLAUDE.md`'s rule 3 used to
// record, and that rule stays withdrawn.
