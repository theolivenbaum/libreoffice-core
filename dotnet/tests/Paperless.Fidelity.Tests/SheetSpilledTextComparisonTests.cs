/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Why a page's word count rather than a cell's placement.</strong> The defect this file
/// exists for was invisible to every positional test in the suite, and had to be, because the
/// runs it lost were never emitted at all: a sheet whose only content is one column of long
/// strings splits into two horizontal pages, and the second page draws <em>nothing</em> — no cell
/// on it holds anything, and the text that belongs there is entirely the first column's spill.
/// A comparison of the runs both renderers drew agrees perfectly on a page neither of them drew
/// anything on. Counting what reaches the page is the claim that fails.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>What the count measures, exactly.</strong> <c>pdftotext</c> discards a glyph whose box
/// lies wholly off the paper and keeps one that straddles the edge, so a string running off the
/// side is counted for the part of it that shows. That is the property under test: LibreOffice
/// draws the whole 187-glyph string on both pages, from the cell's true position, and the two
/// pages between them show every word once plus the one the break falls inside — 25 words on
/// page three, 21 on page four, of a 38-word string.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The lead-in that rule describes is no longer drawn, and this file's own assertion for
/// it was stale for exactly that reason.</strong> <c>ScOutputData::LayoutStrings</c> starts its
/// column loop one column before the block (<c>output2.cxx:1541-1543</c>) so that a long string
/// to the left reaches the page, and <see cref="Paperless.Spreadsheets.Layout.SpreadsheetPages"/>
/// deliberately does not: a rightward overflow is painted on the page holding its anchor cell and
/// on no other. That was settled on 26.2.4.2, the version this tree is developed against, and
/// the assertion here still demanded the older behaviour — so it failed against <em>both</em>
/// binaries, on 24.2.7.2 because ours no longer draws the lead-in and on 26.2.4.2 because it
/// hard-coded a count only 24.2 produces.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The two releases genuinely differ, measured on this fixture with nothing changed but the
/// binary: page four is <b>1 011 words in 48 runs</b> under 24.2.7.2 and <b>3 words in none</b>
/// under 26.2.4.2. It is not the <c>!bTaggedPDF</c> guard that separates them — both write a
/// tagged PDF here, <c>/MarkInfo /Marked true</c> in each — so the behaviour itself moved. A test
/// that compares that page against whatever <c>soffice</c> is installed reports the environment
/// rather than the code, which is why the far page is now asserted against our rule and the
/// anchor page, where the two agree, against the reference.
