/// <remarks>

/// Word by word and absolutely, which for tabs is both possible and the point. A tab's width is not a
/// property of the font — it is the distance to the next stop — so the word after one starts at an absolute
/// position that the document states, and comparing it needs none of the differential machinery
/// justification does. The quantisation that spoils a long line does not accumulate here either, because
/// each stretch between tabs is short and starts afresh at its stop.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The corpus document exercises the four things that can go wrong separately: the default interval, which
/// is a quarter over a centimetre in LibreOffice and not the half inch Word uses; explicit left stops;
/// centre and right stops, where the stretch's own width decides where it starts; and a decimal stop, where
/// the position of a separator inside the stretch decides it.
/// </para>

// [2026-09-06, diagnosed, left failing on purpose] AListLabelsTabAdvancesToLibreOfficesStop fails
// on all four formats and `EveryTabAdvancesToLibreOfficesStop` passes on all four, at the same
// tolerance in the same file — and the pair is the cleanest control in the suite for what is
// actually being measured.
//
// In `tabbed.docx` every stretch after a tab is its own text object with its own `Td`, so the
// reference *states* each position: all three renderings agree at every word to the 0.100 pt pen
// offset below. In `list-label-overrun.docx` the label overruns its stop, so the whole line is one
// text object and every position after the first has to be reconstructed from the PDF's declared
// widths — which LibreOffice writes as **truncated** integer thousandths of an em (every one of
// this document's 26 is `floor(hmtx * 1000 / upem)`, mean deficit 0.482 thousandths). The three
// renderings therefore drift apart word by word: between the two reference binaries alone, 0.000,
// 0.011, 0.044, 0.066, 0.088, 0.099 pt.
//
// So this is not an advance divergence, and the paragraph above about the quantisation "not
// accumulating here" is right about a stretch that starts at a stop and wrong about one that does
// not. Measured through the reference's own `Td` pen, our laid-out widths agree with both binaries
// to 0.011% over 5 faces x 6 units x up to 11 sizes; see `probes/advance-ppem/`. Left failing: only
// writing our PDF with LibreOffice's truncated widths would close it.
