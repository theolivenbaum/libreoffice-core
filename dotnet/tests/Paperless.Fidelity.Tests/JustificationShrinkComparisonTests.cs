/// Word 2013's justification: a full line may squeeze its blanks to hold another word.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The pair of corpus documents is one justified paragraph twice, differing only in the
/// <c>compatibilityMode</c> their <c>settings.xml</c> declares — 15 against 12. LibreOffice turns
/// <c>JustifyLinesWithShrinking</c> on for the first and not for the second
/// (<c>sw/source/writerfilter/dmapper/DomainMapper_Impl.cxx:10172</c>), and sets the same text in
/// four lines rather than five.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A pair rather than one document, because the effect has to be shown to be <em>conditional</em>: an
/// engine that shrank every justified line regardless would agree with the reference on the first
/// document and disagree on the second, and one that shrank none would do the opposite.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Line ends are compared against the reference rather than against stored numbers, so the test stays
/// honest across a LibreOffice upgrade. Measured on 24.2.7.2.
/// </para>
/// </remarks>
// [rule ported 2026-09-06; the residual is handed back] 26.2.4.2 shrinks less than 24.2.7.2 did and
// this pair is where it shows. 24.2.7.2 set the mode-15 document in **4** lines and the mode-12 one in
// 5; 26.2.4.2 sets both in 5. That was recorded as upstream work to follow, and it has now been
// followed: `portxt.cxx`:769-805 does not take the deepest squeeze the 75% floor allows, it weighs the
// blanks the longer line would squeeze against the blanks the shorter line would stretch, discounting
// the stretch by 1/1.7. `JustificationShrink.PrefersShrinking` is that comparison and it calls all six
// decided rows of a text-width sweep of this very paragraph — see `probes/words-justify-shrink/`.
//
// With it in place the pair matches 26.2.4.2 **line for line, both documents**, at text widths of 9639
// and 9637 twips. The fixture's own width is 9638, and that is the one width in the neighbourhood where
// the reference disagrees with itself: sweeping the disputed line's own paragraph a twip at a time,
// 26.2.4.2 takes the word `line` at all thirteen widths from 9631 to 9644 except 9638. 9638 twips is
// exactly the natural advance of that line as the reference measures it — 481.9000 pt against our
// 481.9400 — so the fixture's measure lands on the tie, and 0.8 twips of advance puts us the other side
// of it. `TheParagraphBreaksWhereLibreOfficeBreaksIt` therefore still fails on
// `justify-shrink-2013.docx`, now on line 3 rather than on the line count, and what it is failing on is
// the advance divergence at a tie the reference itself does not resolve consistently. It is not ours to
// close here, and the page width was deliberately not moved to make it green.
