/// It is a blank <em>line</em>, not nothing. An empty paragraph covers no characters, so the run
/// builder placed nothing in it, so slide layout — which drops a paragraph that resolves no face
/// at all — dropped it whole and everything below it moved up by a line. PowerPoint decks use
/// empty paragraphs as spacing constantly, and the PPTX reader has always emitted one run for
/// them; only the binary path did not.

/// Its height is the height of the character run it sits inside rather than the outline level's
/// default, which is the second half of the same defect: authors shrink their blank lines, and
/// taking the level's size instead made every gap too tall. On the fourth page of
/// <c>slides/batch-001/ppt/WC_Update-Aug03.ppt</c>, which separates all eleven of its bullets that
/// way, the level's size overflowed the last item off the bottom of the slide.
