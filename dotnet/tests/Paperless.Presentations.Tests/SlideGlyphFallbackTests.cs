/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The words track wired glyph fallback and the slides track did not, so every deck was laid out
/// with no coverage check at all: <c>SlideTextLayout.Measure</c> called
/// <c>MeasuredParagraph.Measure</c> with no <c>ItemisationOptions</c>, whose default is
/// deliberately no fallback. Both halves of the machinery already existed and were already in use
/// by the word processor and the spreadsheet — <see cref="Paperless.Text.Itemisation.FontItemiser"/>
/// splits a run at the characters its face has no glyph for and <see cref="SystemFontResolver"/>
/// answers "what face has this character" — and one call site never joined them.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No gate column can see the symptom, which is why it is asserted here.</strong> An
/// uncovered character shapes to <c>.notdef</c>; a face that declines to draw a missing-glyph box
/// draws nothing at all, and the code point still reaches the PDF with a correct
/// <c>ToUnicode</c>, so <c>pdftotext</c> extracts it and the word count is unmoved. Measured on
/// the corpus deck <c>southern-classic-kennesaw-state-university-final.pptx</c>, whose body text
/// holds 132 U+25D8 inverse bullets: the reference falls back to DejaVu Sans and embeds it, and we
/// kept Carlito and drew 132 blanks — visible only in <c>pdffonts</c>, at six embedded faces
/// against the reference's seven.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The embedding is asserted separately from the drawing because they fail apart. A face on its
/// own is enough to shape with and not enough to embed: a PDF writer opens the font program
/// through the reference's face key, so a fallback face named only by its family is announced in
/// the file with no program behind it — which the corpus gate scores as a failure, correctly,
/// because a reader without that font installed sees nothing. Neither assertion names a font:
/// which face covers a given character depends on what is installed, so the test asks the
/// resolved face whether it has the glyph rather than asking what it is called.
