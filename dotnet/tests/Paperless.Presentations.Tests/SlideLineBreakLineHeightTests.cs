/// EditEngine's line-metrics loop walks every portion from <c>GetStartPortion()</c> to
/// <c>GetEndPortion()</c> and skips exactly one kind —
/// <c>if ( rTP.GetKind() != PortionKind::LINEBREAK )</c>, with the comment beside it naming this
/// case: <em>"problem with hard font height attribute, when everything but the line break has this
/// attribute"</em> (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx</c>:1498-1516). The kind is set by
/// <c>EE_FEATURE_LINEBR</c> alone (<c>:1088-1099</c>) and the break is the line's last character
/// (<c>pLine-&gt;SetEnd(nPortionStart + 1)</c>, <c>:1441-1449</c>). A line holding nothing else
/// measures zero — <c>EditLine::CalcTextSize</c> adds nothing for that kind
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/EditLine.cxx</c>:69-71) — and takes the fallback above the loop,
/// which seeks the font at <c>GetStart()+1</c>, the break's own character
/// (<c>impedit3.cxx</c>:1478-1491). Read in a checkout declaring <c>27.2.0.0.alpha0+</c>, so the

/// <c>"AAA"</c> + break + <c>"BBB"</c> draws its two baselines at <strong>462.019 and 440.419 on
