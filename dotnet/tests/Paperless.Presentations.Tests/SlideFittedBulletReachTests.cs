/// and stores the whole <c>Size</c> on the paragraph, and the autofit search formats the outliner
/// once unscaled before it walks <c>constScaleLevels</c> — so the call that fills the cache is the
/// unscaled one. EditEngine then takes that width for the first line alone,
/// <c>nStartX = max(textLeft + firstLineOffset, bulletX)</c>
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx</c>:846-851 over the <c>BulletX</c> set at

/// one, and the first line is pushed right by the difference while the bullet glyph is not.

/// <c>lvl2 marL="742950" indent="-285750"</c> and whose runs state 56 pt under a
/// <c>normAutofit</c> that draws them at 14: the reference starts every second-level first line
/// <strong>31.13 pt</strong> past the bullet, which is an en dash at 56 pt and not the 7.79 pt it
/// is at 14. Pinned over twelve one-attribute variants of that one master — four hanging indents,
/// two margins, three bullet characters and three stated run sizes, every one exact — and the
