/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Measured against 26.2.4.2 on an authored deck rather than read out of the importer, because
/// the importer sends the three turning values down three different property paths and two of
/// them turn out to draw the same thing. <c>vert</c> becomes <c>WritingMode2::TB_RL90</c> and
/// <c>eaVert</c> becomes <c>TB_RL</c> with a swapped pair of adjusts
/// (<c>oox/source/drawingml/textbodypropertiescontext.cxx:126-200</c>) — and on Latin text the
/// reference draws <b>165 identical glyph matrices at identical positions</b> for the two, over
/// all three anchors. <c>vert270</c> is the same turn the other way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The other two values of <c>ST_TextVerticalType</c> are deliberately not turns and that was
/// measured on the same deck: <c>mongolianVert</c> draws <b>horizontally</b> — the importer's own
/// comment says the rendering is not implemented for shape text — and <c>wordArtVert</c> stacks
/// one upright glyph per line. Neither appears on any slide part of the 302-document corpus, and
/// this reader draws both horizontally, which is right for the first and wrong for the second.
/// </para>

/// <c>slide-text-vertical.pptx</c> is three identical 230 × 160 pt boxes carrying one 14 pt word
/// each, at <c>horz</c>, <c>vert</c> and <c>vert270</c>, with <b>asymmetric insets</b> of
/// 10 / 20 / 30 / 40 pt. The asymmetry is the whole design: with the DrawingML defaults, or with
/// any symmetric quadruple, a reader that forgets to rotate the insets is indistinguishable from
/// one that remembers. `TextBodyProperties::pushTextDistances` rotates them, and it rotates them
/// in the same direction as the turn.
