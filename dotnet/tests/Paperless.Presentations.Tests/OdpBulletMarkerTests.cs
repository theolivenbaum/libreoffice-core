/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// A bullet level almost always names a symbol face and states its character as that face's own
/// slot in the Private Use Area, which means nothing anywhere else. LibreOffice substitutes
/// OpenSymbol for a symbol face it has not got and recodes the slot to the StarSymbol code point
/// holding the same picture (<c>unotools/source/misc/fontcvt.cxx</c>:185 and :1325); this tree
/// does the same in <c>SlideTextLayout</c>, and the deck reader has kept the slot for it since
/// symbol bullets were implemented.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The ODF path did not, because it took its label from <c>OdfListStyle.FormatLabel</c>, which is
/// the <em>extraction</em> answer and collapses a Private Use Area character to U+2022 — right for
/// an index, and a black dot where the reference draws a green check mark.
/// <strong>3598 bullet levels in 74 of the converted corpus's 302 <c>.odp</c> state a Private Use
/// Area character</strong>, every one of them in the F000 block, and every family they name has a
/// recode table but one.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The colour is a second reading and a wider one: <c>fo:color</c> on the level's own
/// <c>style:text-properties</c>, with <c>style:use-window-font-color="true"</c> meaning the item's
/// own colour instead. <strong>22 436 bullet levels in all 302 state one.</strong>
