/// baselines rather than on a resolved <c>LineMetrics</c>, because a constructed metric would agree
/// with whatever it was constructed with.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><see cref="APptxBodyNeverReachesTheDeviceAtAll"/> is the more surprising half and is here to
/// stop the first being over-generalised.</b> A PPTX or PPT body sets
/// <c>FontIndependentLineSpacing</c>, which sends it to
/// <c>ImplCalculateFontIndependentLineSpacing</c> — twelve tenths of the em, no metric read at all —
/// so the device changes nothing for its paragraphs. Of the 163 presentations in the sample corpus
/// <b>none</b> is an ODP: 112 are pptx and 51 are ppt.

/// <para>
/// <b>Which is not the same as the device being worth nothing to a deck, and the difference was

/// <b>14 of 163</b> documents and the symbol bullet's own baseline (<c>EmitMarker</c>) reaches
/// <b>150</b>. A character bullet is drawn by EditEngine whichever line-spacing rule the paragraph
