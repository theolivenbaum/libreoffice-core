/// <c>vcl/headless/svpgdi.cxx</c>:44). An <c>OutputDevice</c> instantiates a font at a whole

/// every glyph has one design advance, 1229/2048 em, and no kerning pair can be confused with the
/// effect — and it states <strong>three</strong> sizes: 10 pt for the axis labels, where the
/// device rounds 13.333 down to 13; 13 pt for the title, where it rounds 17.333 down to 17; and
/// 9 pt for the axis titles, where 12.0 is already whole and the rule must apply
/// <em>nothing at all</em>. A constant fudge passes the first two and fails the third.
