/// <para>
/// A line's trailing blanks are not part of its width — they hang past its right edge rather than
/// pushing a word onto the next line — so a slide's text layout stops the drawn run at the line's
/// visible end. That is right for a wrapped body and wrong for a chart label, which is an
/// EditEngine text shape autogrown around the paragraph whole. The consequence is one-sided: the
/// value axis reserves its widest label's width, so a lost blank makes the band narrow and the
/// plot area that much too wide, with every gridline and every bar in it displaced.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Excel's accounting formats end their positive and zero subformats in <c>_)</c> — a blank the
/// width of a closing parenthesis — so this fires on every currency axis rather than on a
/// curiosity. <c>Demick_JetBlue.pptx</c> page 5 is the corpus witness, and the rule was measured
/// at 26.2.4.2 by deleting that one token from its format and changing nothing else
/// (<c>probes/chartblank-r191/</c>): the reference's plot area starts at x = 165.71 pt as
/// authored and at 162.65 without it, the gap from the widest label's last glyph to the plot's
/// edge going 5.91 pt to 2.85 — and this tree drew 161.99 and 2.66, which is the without-it
/// answer. Deleting the zero row's two <c>?</c> placeholders instead moves nothing, because that
/// row is not the widest label; deleting the leading <c>_(</c> moves the edge by the same blank
/// again, so both ends count and only the trailing one was lost.
