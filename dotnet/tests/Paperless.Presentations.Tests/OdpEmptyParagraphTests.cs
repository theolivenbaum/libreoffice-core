/// text:style-name="T15"/&gt;&lt;/text:p&gt;</c> — a span carrying the character formatting and
/// no characters — and EditEngine measures that line from the character attributes at the
/// paragraph's own position, which is the span's
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx</c>:1896-1902). Reading the paragraph's own cascade
/// instead gives the shape's default size, which on a presentation placeholder is far larger.

/// This is the whole of what a blind reading of three corpus slides reported as

/// every gap, and the reading measured 19.2. Nothing was <em>added</em>, no margins were being
