/// A hyperlink in a draw shape's text is not a character property: it is an EditEngine
/// <em>field</em>. <c>xmloff/source/text/txtparai.cxx</c>:1352-1370 asks the cursor for a
/// <c>HyperLinkURL</c> property and builds an <c>XMLImpHyperlinkContext_Impl</c> when it has one

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two rules follow, and neither is visible in the formatting. A field is one portion, so a field
/// wider than the room left on its line is filled to the <em>cell</em> — every character, on Latin
/// text — rather than moved down or broken at a separator
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit3.cxx</c>:1101-1200). And the lines it spills onto belong to
/// the line that holds it, so each is drawn one <em>ascent</em> below the last rather than one line
/// height (<c>:3778-3795</c>, whose comment says so), and the formatter never sees them at all —
/// the block's measured height, which is what anchors it and what the shrink-to-fit search
/// measures, counts the field's line once.
