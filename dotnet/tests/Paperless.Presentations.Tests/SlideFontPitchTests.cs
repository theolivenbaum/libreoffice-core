/// A family fontconfig files under no generic at all takes its sans-serif default, which is what
/// LibreOffice draws it in — and a declared <em>fixed</em> pitch overrides that, because a document
/// relying on its columns lining up is making the stronger statement.
/// <c>Lucida Console</c> is both at once: <c>VCL.xcu</c> calls it monospaced, fontconfig files it
/// nowhere, and which of the two the reference follows turns entirely on whether the deck says so.
/// </para>

/// <strong>Measured on the running 26.2.4.2, twice.</strong> On the corpus,
/// <c>airbus-powerpoint-presentation-2019-20…pptx</c> and <c>introduction_to_bea_tuxedo.ppt</c>
/// both embed DejaVu Sans Mono in the reference PDF and both declare Lucida Console fixed. In
/// isolation, re-zipping the first deck with the single attribute <c>pitchFamily="49"</c> removed
/// and nothing else changed makes LibreOffice draw DejaVu <em>Sans</em> instead — the probe is
/// <c>dotnet/probes/font-class-01/pitchprobe.sh</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>No committed fixture can carry the PPTX half.</strong> Every <c>.pptx</c> in
/// <c>tests/corpus/features</c> is a LibreOffice export and its exporter writes
/// <c>pitchFamily="0"</c> on every typeface it emits — scanned, 16 of 16 — so a fixture-based test
/// would pin the no-op and nothing else. The corpus rules forbid committing a deck from the web.
/// The binary half <em>can</em> be built by hand and is, below; the shared decoding is pinned
/// directly; and the PPTX plumbing rests on the two measurements above.
