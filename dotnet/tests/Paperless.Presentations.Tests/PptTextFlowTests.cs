/// <para>
/// <c>ppt-text-flow.ppt</c> holds three identical 2.4 × 1.6 in boxes side by side, each reading
/// "Ag" at 16 pt, each anchored top, each with the same insets — and three different values of
/// Escher property 136: <c>mso_txflHorzN</c> (0), <c>mso_txflTtoBA</c> (1) and
/// <c>mso_txflBtoT</c> (2), left to right. Only that one property differs between them, and it
/// differs in four bytes: the file is a LibreOffice export whose three shapes' <c>WrapText</c>
/// entries were rewritten in place by <c>probes/slides-r56/repid-textflow.py</c>, so nothing else
/// about the boxes can have moved.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Measured on LibreOffice 26.2.4.2, which is what makes these the right assertions.</b> On
/// the six-arm probe (<c>probes/slides-r56/patch-textflow.py</c>, which patches the same property
/// in a corpus document that already carries it) values 1, 3 and 5 all draw the text matrix
/// <c>0 -1 1 0</c> at identical pens and value 2 draws <c>0 1 -1 0</c>; 0 and 4 leave the text
/// upright. Our own pens land on the reference's to <b>0.05 pt on 18 of 18</b> — three anchors ×
/// two directions × three boxes.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The assertions below are stated as <em>relations</em> between the three boxes rather than as
/// absolute points, so nothing here depends on the face's ascent — the one quantity in the
/// arithmetic that belongs to the machine rather than to the file.
