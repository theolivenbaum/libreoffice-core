/// Bars, candles and up-down bars used to be emitted as <c>ChartBox</c> and are now
/// <c>ChartShape</c>, because a chart's Z order requires it: every consumer paints
/// <c>Boxes</c> before <c>Lines</c>, so a bar left in <c>Boxes</c> is drawn *under* the
/// gridlines and each major tick rules a light-grey line across it — the "bars filled with
/// horizontal stripes" this repository's parity sweep found on three unrelated workbooks.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The tests that assert where a bar sits therefore have to measure a path rather than read a
/// <c>Bounds</c>, and they should not each re-derive how. A rectangular path's extent is just
/// the extent of its points; nothing here is drawn with a curve, so the control points of a
/// <c>CubicTo</c> are deliberately included too — for a shape that had one, ignoring them
/// would understate the extent rather than overstate it, and an understated bar is the
/// direction that makes a "the label sits above the bar" assertion pass when it should not.
