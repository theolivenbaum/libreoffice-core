/// <para>
/// A rotated label is the one axis mark whose anchor cannot be checked by eye on a chart whose
/// categories are all the same length: corner-anchoring and centre-anchoring then differ by one
/// constant, so the axis looks merely shifted rather than wrong. It is only when the labels differ
/// in length that the two arrangements separate — and then a short name lands inside a long
/// neighbour, which is the defect these tests exist to keep closed.

/// The quantity asserted is deliberately the one that can be read out of a reference PDF without
/// knowing anything about side bearings: <strong>how far the right-hand end of one label is from
/// the right-hand end of the next</strong>. Corner-anchored it is one category slot, whatever the
/// names are; centred it is a slot plus half the difference of two widths. Measured on
/// <c>057_Simple_balance_sheet_Use_this_template_e2d4cbb2.xlsx</c>, whose chart sheet turns twenty
