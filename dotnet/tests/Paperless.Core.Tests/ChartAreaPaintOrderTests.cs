/// (<c>chart2/source/view/charttypes/AreaChart.cxx:565-568</c>), which is tdf#127813's switch —

/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Found by a page reading and then measured.</strong> A reviewer given only the composed
/// halves of <c>006_advanced_powerpoint_area.pptx</c> page 1 ranked "the dominant colour of the
/// area chart flips from blue to red" as the loudest difference on the page, and said the two
/// silhouettes and the crossing point are identical — which is what says it is a paint order and
/// not a value. Reversing the emission takes that page from
/// <c>diff% 18.67, |ink|% 1.54, MAJOR</c> to <c>diff% 0.84, |ink|% 0.03, ok</c>.

/// <strong>A stacked area is exempt and that is a measurement, not the source.</strong>
/// <c>m_bArea</c> does not exempt it, but <c>stacked_area_chart.pptx</c> is
/// <c>diff% 1.82, |ink|% 0.16</c> in file order and <c>1.87 / 0.22</c> reversed: its bands abut
/// rather than nest, so the shared edge belongs to whichever polygon is drawn last, and the
