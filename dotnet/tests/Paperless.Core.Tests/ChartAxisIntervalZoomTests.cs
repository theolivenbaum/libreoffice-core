/// <c>chart2</c> composes a chart on its own draw page at the type size the file states and
/// knows nothing about what scales the picture afterwards — Calc's print zoom is applied by
/// <c>ScPrintFunc</c> to the output device, long after the axis has chosen its interval. This
/// tree takes the zoom through the type sizes instead, so that every glyph run stays in page
/// coordinates (<c>SheetChart.Sized</c>), and one measurement then has to be taken at the size
/// the file states rather than at the zoomed one: the interval cap, which is the axis' drawn
/// length over a <em>device-quantised</em> label height
/// (<c>VCartesianAxis::estimateMaximumAutoMainIncrementCount</c>,

/// Every other length in the composition is scaled on both sides of that division and cancels.
/// This one does not, because a chart's text is measured on a 96 dpi device: a face is
/// instantiated at a whole number of pixels, so its line height is a step function of the size
/// rather than a fixed fraction of the em. The ruler below reproduces exactly that step, which
/// is what makes the two calls below able to disagree at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The witness is <c>040_Blood_pressure_tracker</c>: a fit-to-width sheet drawn at 64%, whose
/// secondary value axis 26.2.4.2 labels <c>60 65 70 75 80</c> and which this tree labelled
/// <c>62 64 … 80</c> — a cap of 10 where the reference's is 8, from that rounding alone.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Round 110 removed the reason the sheet path needs this, and kept the property and
/// these tests.</strong> <c>SheetChart</c> no longer scales the type: it lays the chart out on
/// the chart's own page — the anchor before the sheet's zoom, which is what
/// <c>&lt;chart:chart svg:width&gt;</c> says the reference does — and scales the finished
/// drawing, so the zoom reaches no measurement at all and <see cref="ChartPlot.TypeScale"/> is
/// 1 everywhere. What is asserted below is still exactly true of the property, and it is the
