/// <see cref="SheetDrawing.Crop"/> carries them, and <c>SheetPageGraphics</c> grows the rectangle
/// and takes the clip.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>The clip is new here.</b> Nothing on this path clipped a picture before: <c>DrawImage</c>
/// was called with the anchor's box and no <c>Save</c>/<c>ClipPath</c>/<c>Restore</c> around it.
/// A larger destination without that clip does not crop a picture, it draws the whole of it over
/// the cells on every side — so the two halves are one change and are tested together.

/// <c>picture-crop.xls</c> is that file through <c>soffice --convert-to xls</c>, which is what
/// turns the <c>a:srcRect</c> into Escher's 256–259. The image is 100 × 100 pixels and the size
/// is load-bearing: BIFF export states the crop in the <em>bitmap's</em> pixels, so an 8-pixel
