/// every automatic axis line and gridline in a workbook was stroked at width zero. And a
/// DrawingML width is kept as a whole hundredth of a millimetre, not as its EMU: 9525 EMU is
/// 26.458 of them and the reference keeps 26, which is 0.73701 pt and never 0.75.

/// The reference's own numbers on this fixture are 0.7357 and 2.2354, which are those widths
