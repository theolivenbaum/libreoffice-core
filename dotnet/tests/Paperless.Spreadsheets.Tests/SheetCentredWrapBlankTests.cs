/// <summary>
/// A centred wrapping cell keeps the word its line begins with.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>This is a lost-text defect wearing an alignment defect's clothes.</strong> A wrapped
/// line keeps the spaces it broke after, because Calc's own output draws them
/// (<c>SheetTextLayout.Wrap</c> takes a line to its <c>End</c> and not to its <c>VisibleEnd</c>).
/// Centring the line against that width subtracts half the blank from the <em>left</em>, so a
/// line whose trailing blanks outweigh its text starts outside the cell — and the cell's own clip
/// then removes whatever begins there. Nothing warns; the characters are simply not on the page.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on <c>Infotabelle_WLAN im Flugzeug.xlsx</c> page 2, a German airline price table
/// whose runs of spaces stand in for tab stops. Its second line carried 46 trailing spaces worth
/// 151 pt of a 436 pt line against 283.1 pt of room, so the line was placed at x = −25.2 pt in a
/// cell clipped from 50.4 pt, and the bold word <c>kostenlos</c> that began it was drawn entirely
/// outside. The PDF's text layer held <c>kostenlos</c> five times against the reference's six,
/// and it holds six now. The word was in the file, in <c>paperless extract</c>, in the wrapped
/// line's own range and in the shaped run the whole time — only the placement lost it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Against LibreOffice 26.2.4.2's own PDF of that page: the reference draws the two affected
/// lines at 52.044 pt and 52.611 pt and we now draw both at 51.392 pt, the remaining 0.7 pt being
/// the cell margin and the same on every cell in the file. Before, the second was not drawn.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture is flat ODF and deliberately smaller than the corpus document: one 4 cm centred
/// wrapping cell holding <c>WESTERLY</c>, 44 spaces and <c>EASTERLY</c>, which is enough to make
/// the first line overflow by more than the width of the word on it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The placement guard is still here and is no longer what makes this fixture right.</strong>
/// This class used to assert that the first line was the word plus all 44 of its blanks, 177.37 pt
/// of it on a 110 pt line, and that the guard then pulled it back to the cell's left margin. That
/// was the symptom clamped rather than the cause removed, and the class's own remark said so:
/// "EditEngine keeps only the blanks that fit". It now does — <see cref="Paperless.Text.Layout.LineFiller"/>
/// breaks behind the blank that overflows — so the same fixture breaks into three lines where it
/// used to break into two, and the guard has nothing left to correct.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Re-measured against LibreOffice 26.2.4.2's own PDF of this fixture, which is what the counts
/// below are: the reference draws <strong>29</strong> glyphs at x = 171.47, then <strong>23</strong>
/// blanks at x = 196.19, then <strong>8</strong> at x = 200.64. We draw 29, 23 and 8 at 171.07,
/// 194.80 and 200.63. Before the break rule changed we drew 52 glyphs and then 8, so the line
/// structure disagreed with the reference's even where the placement had been corrected to agree.
/// </para>
