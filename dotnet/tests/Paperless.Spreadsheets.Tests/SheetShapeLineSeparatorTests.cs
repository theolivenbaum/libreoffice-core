/// <strong>LibreOffice never sees the separator as a character.</strong> Every importer hands its
/// string to the EditEngine — <c>TextRun::insertAt</c> calls <c>xText-&gt;insertString</c>
/// (<c>oox/source/drawingml/textrun.cxx</c>:124) — and
/// <c>ImpEditEngine::ImpInsertText</c> normalises the line ends with
/// <c>convertLineEnd(rStr, LINEEND_LF)</c>, then walks the string from separator to separator and
/// calls <c>ImpInsertParaBreak</c> whenever the separator was not the end of it
/// (<c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit2.cxx</c>:2864-2983). Its own comment names the case two in a
/// row make: <c>// Start == End =&gt; empty line</c>. So <c>CCC\n\nDDD</c> is three paragraphs, the
/// middle one empty.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Shaping the separator instead loses a whole line of height.</strong> That is what this
/// painter did: <c>U+000A</c> went through the shaper as an ordinary character, came out
/// zero-width, and joined the two sentences into one run — which made the body one line
/// <em>shorter</em> than the reference's and so, on a box stating <c>vertOverflow="clip"</c>,
/// stopped the clip firing at all. On
/// <c>070_Equipment_inventory_list_Use_this_template_fd524c8a.xlsx</c>'s three slicer
/// placeholders the notice is six line slots with the breaks and five without, the boxes hold
/// five, and 26.2.4.2 drops the last line of each while we drew all of it: 1128 alphanumerics
/// against the reference's 1028, and 1004 now. A lost paragraph and an unfired clip are one cause
/// there, not two.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The fixture varies the number of separators and nothing else.</strong> Two text boxes
/// on one sheet, one 12 pt Liberation Sans run each, wide enough not to wrap and tall enough not
/// to clip: <c>AAA\nBBB</c> and <c>CCC\n\nDDD</c>. The second gap must be exactly twice the first,
/// which is the empty paragraph stated as arithmetic rather than as a line count.
