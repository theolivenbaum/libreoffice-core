/// A watermark picture on a sheet: <c>xdr:blipFill/a:blip/a:alphaModFix</c>, and the opacity it
/// has to reach the sink at.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>This is the defect no gate column can see.</b> A picture anchored over eighteen rows of
/// text and painted opaque hides the text and leaves every word of it in the PDF's text layer, so
/// page count, extractable words and font embedding all read correct while the page is unreadable.
/// Measured on <c>SIL_TDB648.xlsx</c>, whose <c>General Info</c> sheet states
/// <c>a:alphaModFix amt="20000"</c> on a full-width photograph: its word column read 7499 against
/// 7497 while about 85% of the body copy was buried. The arithmetic confirms the number rather
/// than only the fact — the reference's faded pixels sample at RGB 217/223/233 against our opaque
/// 74/97/157, and <c>0.2·74 + 0.8·255 = 219</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>It is not a paint-order defect</b>, which is what it looks like and what was suspected
/// first. Calc prints <c>SC_LAYER_BACK</c> before the cell text and <c>SC_LAYER_FRONT</c> after
/// (<c>sc/source/ui/view/printfun.cxx:1651</c> and <c>:1699</c>); a sheet picture is on the front
/// layer, so drawing it after the strings — which <see cref="SheetPageGraphics"/> already did — is
/// correct. Moving it behind the text would have hidden this on one document and been wrong on
/// every other.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture states the attribute on one picture and omits it on a second, and both are asserted.
/// Half of this test is the control: a reader that faded every picture would pass a fixture holding
/// only the faded one.
