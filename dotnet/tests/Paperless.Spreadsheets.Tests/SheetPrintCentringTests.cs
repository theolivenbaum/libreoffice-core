/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A single column cannot be split, which is what makes the case reachable.</strong> A
/// block of several columns wider than the page paginates into a second page column instead of
/// overflowing; one column wider than the page has nowhere to break, so it is drawn overflowing
/// and the centring decides where. That is
/// <c>048_Expense_trends_budget_18d1e8ba.xlsx</c>'s <c>tips</c> sheet — one column of 152.33
/// characters under <c>printOptions/@horizontalCentered</c> — where every line of page 1 sat
/// <strong>167.3 pt</strong> right of 26.2.4.2's, the same constant on all nineteen, and the
/// reference lost <c>TEMPLAT</c> off the left edge while we chopped only at the right. 4088
/// alphanumerics against the reference's 3986, and 3999 now.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The fixture measures the centre rather than the edge, so no character-width conversion
/// is in the way.</strong> Two sheets, each one column holding one <c>horizontal="center"</c>
/// marker: the marker's own centre is the column's centre and therefore the block's, and the rule
/// says that lands on the printable area's centre — 306 pt on Letter with equal 0.7 inch margins —
/// whether the block is 160 characters wide or 20. Under the clamp the wide sheet's marker sits
/// near 470 pt instead.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both expectations are the reference's own. LibreOffice <b>26.2.4.2</b> renders the committed
