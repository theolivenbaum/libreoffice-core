/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <c>PrintHF</c> does its whole arithmetic in logical twips and lets the map mode apply the zoom
/// to all of it at once (<c>sc/source/ui/view/printfun.cxx:1867</c>, <c>:2645</c>), so
/// <c>nDif = paperHeight - textHeight</c> reaches the paper as
/// <c>(paperHeight - textHeight) x zoom / 2</c>. <see cref="SheetPageDecoration"/> holds the text
/// height already scaled and the band as the file states it, and comparing the two overstates
/// <c>nDif</c> by <c>height x (1 - zoom)</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// That is invisible without a print scale and it cost whole bands with one.
/// <c>sheets/done-014/xls/TICAPCapability_Final.xls</c> prints at 35 %: its band is 30.16 pt
/// stated and its text 7.82 pt drawn, the mixed arithmetic put the pen 6.17 pt below the band's
/// top, and the ink then began below the clip rectangle — so the area missed the window
/// altogether and <strong>six pages lost their header and their footer</strong>, seventeen words
/// each, on a document that had been word-exact against the reference on every one of them.
/// Three more corpus documents lost 8, 18 and 195 words the same way.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>sheet-band-scale-pinned.fods</c> is authored to the smallest case that shows it: letter
/// portrait at <c>style:scale-to="35%"</c>, a 0.42 in band with no gap, and one short line in
/// each of the header and the footer, so both have room to spare. ODF is the format that can
/// state it — <c>XlsxPrintSetup</c> flags every SpreadsheetML band dynamic, which takes the other
/// arm. Both installed references put the header's ink box at <strong>39.340</strong> and the
/// footer's at <strong>748.702</strong>, and the body cell between them at 46.834.
