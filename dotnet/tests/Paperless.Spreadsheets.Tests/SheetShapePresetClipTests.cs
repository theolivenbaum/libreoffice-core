/// <summary>
/// What a <c>vertOverflow="clip"</c> body is measured against, and what it is measured with.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="SheetShapeClipTests"/> pins the fact that the clip removes lines. This pins the two
/// quantities the decision is made from, because getting either wrong loses text the reference
/// draws or draws text it does not — and the corpus has both failures at once.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The rectangle is the preset's, not the anchor's box.</strong> A DrawingML preset may
/// carry an <c>a:rect</c> of four guide expressions, and <c>roundRect</c>'s insets it by
/// <c>x1 * 29289/100000</c> on every side, where <c>x1 = min(w, h) * adj/100000</c> — so a
/// stadium-shaped button at <c>adj="50000"</c> loses <c>0.1464 * min(w, h)</c> from each edge
/// before the text insets are taken. LibreOffice lays the text out in that rectangle
/// (<c>EnhancedCustomShape2d::GetTextRect</c>), and <c>aAnchorTextRange</c> — the height the clip
/// range is built from, <c>svx/source/svdraw/svdotextdecomposition.cxx:622-624</c> — is what is
/// left of it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The test is on the portion's ink, not on its line box.</strong>
/// <c>TextHierarchyBreakupBlockText::processDrawPortionInfo</c> keeps a portion only when its
/// start position — the baseline — and both corners of
/// <c>TextLayouterDevice::getTextBoundRect</c> lie inside the clip range
/// (<c>svx/source/svdraw/svdoutl.cxx:120-160</c>), and its own header says why that is not
/// geometric clipping: "only text portions completely inside are to be accepted"
/// (<c>include/svx/svdoutl.hxx:56-59</c>). So a line whose box overflows still draws when its
/// letters do not reach the edge, and two labels of one size in one box get opposite answers when
/// one of them has a descender.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The fixture is four cells and changes one thing at a time.</strong> All four bodies are
/// one 20 pt Liberation Sans run in a 300 pt-wide shape stating <c>vertOverflow="clip"</c>; the
/// face is named rather than inherited so the arithmetic below is not at the mercy of what a
/// theme resolves to. Liberation Sans at 20 pt is an 18.11 pt ascent, a 23.00 pt line and a
/// 4.24 pt ink descender on <c>p</c> and <c>y</c>.
