/// a count and a list of ranges — rendered the corpus's 64 <c>.xls</c> with and without it, got
/// 64 byte-identical PDFs, and concluded that a BIFF conditional format has no reach. The rules
/// are in the <c>CF</c> records that follow the header, so a reader that stops there cannot move
/// a pixel whatever the corpus holds, and the byte-identity was a property of the instrument.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Asked of 26.2.4.2 instead — <c>--convert-to fods</c> over every <c>.xls</c> that states the
/// record — the reference resolves <strong>149 conditional formats and 187 conditions in 5 of the
/// 64</strong>, of which 175 name a style carrying a fill, a font colour or bold.
/// </para>

/// The fixture is 26.2.4.2's own <c>.xls</c> export of a flat ODS stating two rules, so the
/// records are written by a real producer rather than by hand, and every expectation below is

/// with their text bold, two green fills on <c>B2</c> and <c>B4</c>, and nothing on the two rows
