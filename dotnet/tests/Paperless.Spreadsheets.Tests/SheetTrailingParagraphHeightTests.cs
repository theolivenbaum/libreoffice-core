/// Calc measures a multi-paragraph cell through the EditEngine and its height is
/// <c>pEngine-&gt;GetTextHeight()</c> over every paragraph the importer made
/// (<c>sc/source/core/data/column2.cxx</c>:571-577); ODF's filter makes one paragraph per
/// <c>text:p</c>, the trailing empty one included. So a cell ending in a hard break reserves a
/// line for the paragraph after it — a line that draws no glyph, which is why the difference
/// appears in the row height and nowhere in the text.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// This tree already counted it for a cell in one format, because
/// <see cref="SheetTextLayout.LineCount"/> splits on the break before it wraps anything and a
/// trailing break leaves an empty final piece. A cell in several formats goes through
/// <see cref="SheetTextLayout.RichLineRanges"/> instead, and the layouter there ends a paragraph
/// on its break without opening the empty one after it — <c>"a\n"</c> lays out as one line. The
/// two answers have to agree, because Calc's do.

/// The fixture's expected heights were read out of 26.2.4.2's own <c>--convert-to fods</c> of it

/// characters without the empty paragraph and must not move, and the third is a single line.
