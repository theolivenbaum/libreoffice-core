/// <c>sheet-shape-ink.xlsx</c>, so all three of this project's spreadsheet families answer for the
/// same five shapes. The <c>.xls</c> states them as Escher properties rather than as markup:
/// <c>fillColor</c> (385), <c>fFilled</c> (443), <c>lineColor</c> (448), <c>lineWidth</c> (459)
/// and <c>fLine</c> (508), none of which anything in this tree read — <c>git grep</c> found no use
/// of any of the five identifiers before round 84, although they had been named for years.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The converter has already resolved the theme, so 26.2.4.2's <c>.xls</c> draws the themed box in
/// the same <c>#4472C4</c> at the same 2.013 pt as its <c>.xlsx</c>: the interesting thing here is
/// not the resolution but that an <c>MSO_CLR</c> is <c>0x00BBGGRR</c> and reads inverted if it is
/// taken as an <c>0x00RRGGBB</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two things this path still does not do, and both are recorded rather than fixed.</strong>
/// Escher states a rotation in property 4 and nothing reads it, so the turned elbow is drawn
/// upright; and a group's leaves carry no <c>ftCmo</c> of their own, so the two ellipses reach
/// neither the model nor the page. Both are visible against the reference's own marks, and neither
/// is what this fixture is asserting.
