/// <para>
/// A string too wide for its column spills into the empty cells beside it and Calc widens the
/// print area to cover all of it (<c>ScTable::ExtendPrintArea</c>,
/// <c>sc/source/core/data/table1.cxx</c>:2127, per cell in <c>MaybeAddExtraColumn</c> at
/// <c>:2218</c>). How wide "all of it" is comes from <c>ScColumn::GetNeededSize</c>, which sends
/// an <c>EditTextObject</c> cell through the EditEngine (<c>column2.cxx</c>:297-300), formats it
/// against a paper 1000000 units wide so that nothing is broken for width (<c>:447</c>), and reads
/// <c>pEngine-&gt;CalcTextWidth()</c> (<c>:565</c>) — which is a maximum over the paragraphs
/// (<c>ImpEditEngine::CalcTextWidth</c>, <c>editeng/source/editeng/impedit2.cxx</c>:3507-3525).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Which cells have several paragraphs is the importer's answer: Calc's ODF filter never puts the
/// engine into single-line mode, so a hard break makes a paragraph, while the BIFF and
/// SpreadsheetML filters do and the break stays a character inside one line. That is the same
/// distinction <see cref="SheetLayout.CellBreaksStartLines"/> carries for the drawing.
/// </para>
/// <para>

/// on a 10 cm body, separated by newlines on one sheet and by spaces on the other. 26.2.4.2
/// renders it in <strong>four</strong> pages — one and three — and each sheet alone in one and
/// three. Measuring the whole string in both is what put
/// <c>CIS_Debian_Linux_8_Benchmark_v1.0.0.ods</c> at 88 pages against 61.
