/// round-trip form, which is what <see cref="ChartDataLabel.Write"/> falls back to when no format
/// reaches it. The number-format engine was moved down into <c>Paperless.Core</c> precisely so a
/// chart axis composed in <c>Core/Charts</c> could call it; the OOXML and ODF readers set
/// <see cref="ChartPlot.ValueFormat"/> from an axis element their markup carries, and the BIFF
/// reader set nothing, so on this path the engine was reachable and never called.

/// axis' own <c>CHFORMAT</c> when it resolves and turns <c>LinkNumberFormatToSource</c>
/// <em>off</em>; otherwise the axis links to its source and
/// <c>AxisHelper::getExplicitNumberFormatKeyForAxis</c>
