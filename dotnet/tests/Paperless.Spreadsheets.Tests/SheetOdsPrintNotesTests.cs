/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The pagination this drives is <see cref="SheetPrintNotesTests"/>' — the same
/// <c>ScPrintFunc::DoNotes</c> port, the same <c>"GW99999:"</c> mark column, the same column-major
/// order and the same 200 twips between notes. What was missing on the ODF path was neither of
/// those: it was the two <em>inputs</em>, and each hides in a different place.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The flag is a token inside <c>style:print</c>.</strong> ODF states what a page layout
/// prints as a space-separated list, and <c>annotations</c> is the word Calc's
/// <c>ATTR_PAGE_NOTES</c> arrives as — <c>PROP_PrintAnnotations</c> is mapped from that token by
/// <c>XMLPMPropHdl_Print(XML_ANNOTATIONS)</c>
/// (<c>xmloff/source/style/PageMasterStyleMap.cxx:80</c>,
/// <c>PageMasterPropHdlFactory.cxx:85</c>), and <c>ScPrintFunc</c> reads the item into
/// <c>aTableParam.bNotes</c> (<c>sc/source/ui/view/printfun.cxx:944</c>).
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The notes themselves are fastened to their cells by containment</strong>, as
/// <c>office:annotation</c> children of the <c>table:table-cell</c> — so the address comes from
/// the walk and not from an attribute, and the reader has to be a second walk of the table rather
/// than a read of the content tree, which hoists an annotation out of its cell.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>And the author line is inside the text rather than in <c>dc:creator</c></strong>, which
/// says <c>Unknown Author</c> on every note this fixture holds while the printed page opens each
/// one with <c>Probe:</c>. A reader that composed the two would print the wrong name.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture is 26.2.4.2's own <c>--convert-to fods</c> of <c>sheet-print-notes.xls</c>, so the
/// markup is what LibreOffice itself writes for a workbook asking for note pages, and its own
/// rendering of the converted file is the ground truth: <strong>two pages</strong>, the second
/// listing <c>A1:</c>, <c>A2:</c>, <c>C1:</c> in that order. Column-major is the discriminating
/// half — reading order would put <c>C1</c> second.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Reach is <strong>2 of the 307 converted <c>.ods</c></strong>, and both were failing:
/// <c>Hazard Analysis Template.ods</c> at 2 pages against 3 and 2131 characters against 3313, and
/// <c>RMP 2011-2014 and Inventory.ods</c> at 36 pages against 38. Both are page-exact after this,
/// the second character-exact as well.
