/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// ODF's <c>table:print-ranges</c> is a <em>space</em>-separated list of range addresses in the
/// OOO convention, and a sheet name holding a space is written quoted — which Calc's own export
/// does on every range it writes, because it always qualifies both ends with the sheet name. So
/// a perfectly ordinary sheet called <c>Q1 Sales</c> produces
/// <c>'Q1 Sales'.B2:'Q1 Sales'.C4</c>, and splitting that on every space gives three fragments.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The failure is silent rather than loud, which is why it survived: two of the three fragments
/// fail to parse and the third — <c>Sales'.C4</c> — parses, because stripping the sheet
/// qualifier takes everything up to the last dot. It yields the single cell the range ended at.
/// A valid print area comes back, the sheet paginates to one page holding one cell, and nothing
/// anywhere reports a problem.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Calc tokenises the same list with <c>ScRangeStringConverter::GetTokenByOffset</c>, whose
/// <c>IndexOf</c> carries a <c>bQuoted</c> flag toggled by every apostrophe and stops at the
/// separator only outside one (<c>sc/source/core/tool/rangeutl.cxx</c>:552-576, :35-56). The
/// separator defaults to a space and the quote to an apostrophe
/// (<c>sc/inc/rangeutl.hxx</c>:119-120). Toggling per apostrophe is also what makes the OOO
/// convention's doubled <c>''</c> escape inside a name come out right: two toggles leave the
/// flag where it was.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// SpreadsheetML has the identical problem with a comma — <c>'Q1, Q2'!$A$1</c> — and
/// <c>XlsxPrintNames</c> had solved it there since before this was found, which is why the
/// splitting is now <see cref="SheetAddress.SplitList"/>'s and only the separator is the
/// format's.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Ground truth for the fixture is 26.2.4.2's own PDF of it: one page carrying B2, B3, B4, C2,
