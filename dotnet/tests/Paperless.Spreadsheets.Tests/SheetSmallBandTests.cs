/// <summary>
/// A SpreadsheetML header or footer band prints whenever its margins leave it any room at all,
/// starts at the band's own top edge when its text does not fit, and prints nothing when the two
/// margins are equal.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// Three separate rules, and each was wrong in a different way. The first is the one that cost
/// words: <c>XlsxPrintSetup</c> and <c>XlsbPrintSetup</c> set no band gap, so both inherited
/// <see cref="SheetPrintSetup"/>'s ODF default of <strong>142 twips</strong>;
/// <c>SheetPageDecoration.DrawBand</c> lays text into <c>bandHeight - gap</c> and returns on a
/// negative rectangle, so <em>every</em> band under 7.1 pt was dropped outright — no ink and no
/// words. Calc's own distance is <c>max(0, statedBand - nominal)</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/pagesettings.cxx:1029-1041</c>), which is nothing on a band that was
/// already too short; <c>XlsPrintSetup</c> has had that rule since it was written and the other
/// two readers simply never called it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture is authored to the three shapes rather than copied, one worksheet each, letter
/// portrait, a 0.5 in top margin and no header:
/// </para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item><c>Pinned</c> — 0.30 in bottom against a 0.25 in footer margin, so the stated band is
/// <strong>0.05 in = 3.6 pt</strong> and its 9 pt text cannot fit. Its footer also carries both
/// spellings of <c>&amp;K</c> at once.</item>
/// <item><c>Zero</c> — 0.30 in against 0.30 in, a stated band of exactly nothing.</item>
/// <item><c>Roomy</c> — 0.60 in against 0.25 in, a stated band of 25.2 pt, which fits.</item>
/// <item><c>Spill</c> — the pinned band again, but with a footer of <em>three</em> 9 pt lines.
/// Two of them fit between the band's top at 770.4 pt and the 792 pt page edge; the third has its
/// baseline past the paper and neither side's PDF holds it.</item>
/// <item><c>Snug</c> — 0.30 in against 0.10 in, a stated band of 14.4 pt. This one exists to
/// catch the <em>over-general</em> version of the clamp and nothing else: it fits, but only just,
/// and a clamp taken against the text rectangle's top rather than the band's own edge moves it
/// 2.2 pt. A probe caught that before this fixture did.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>
/// Every expectation below is read off LibreOffice <strong>26.2.4.2</strong>'s own PDF of the
/// fixture: <c>LEFTPIN</c> and <c>RIGHTPIN</c> at y 770.355, no <c>ZEROBAND</c> anywhere, and
/// <c>ROOMYBAND</c> at y 762.800 and <c>SNUGBAND</c> at 773.600. 770.4 pt is the pinned band's
/// top edge on a 792 pt page
/// (<c>792 - 0.30 in</c>) to a twentieth of a point, which is what pins the second rule.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The zero band is a reversal.</strong> <c>SheetPageDecoration</c> used to say a band of
/// no height is still drawn, measured on 24.2.7.2 against
/// <c>2012-GA-Survey-Chapter-6-Tables-16Dec2013-V2.xls</c>. On 26.2.4.2 that document's reference
