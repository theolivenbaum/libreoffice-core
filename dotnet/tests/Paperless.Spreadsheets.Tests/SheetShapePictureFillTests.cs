/// A worksheet shape whose own interior is a bitmap: <c>a:blipFill</c> inside
/// <c>xdr:sp/xdr:spPr</c>, which is a fill and not an <c>xdr:pic</c>.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// It was drawn with no interior at all. <c>XlsxDrawings</c> returned early for a shape because
/// its <c>picture</c> is the <c>xdr:pic</c> element and there is none, and <c>XlsxShapeInk</c>
/// resolves <c>a:solidFill</c>, <c>a:gradFill</c>, <c>a:grpFill</c> and the style matrix and has
/// no blip branch — its <c>StatesFill</c> guard names <c>blipFill</c> only so
/// as to suppress the theme fallback, so the shape ended with no fill whatever. That was a
/// deliberate choice while <c>Ink</c> carried colours alone: its remarks recorded that painting a
/// picture fill's first colour flat "would be a confident wrong answer rather than an absent one".
/// The answer is to draw the bitmap, not to approximate it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Only the spreadsheet reader had the hole.</strong> <c>PptxSlideLayout</c> and
/// <c>DocxPictures</c> both resolve the same element, which is why this is routed through the
/// picture path below the shape rather than into a second image path of its own: the blip choice,
/// <c>a:alphaModFix</c> and <c>a:srcRect</c> are already done there.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Only <c>a:stretch</c>.</strong> A stretched bitmap fills the shape's rectangle, which
/// is exactly what the picture path draws, so the two are the same operation. <c>a:tile</c> is a
/// repeat at the blip's own size with its own offsets and is left unfilled as before — a tile
/// painted stretched would be a confident wrong answer where today there is an absent one. No
/// corpus shape tiles: the ten are all <c>prstGeom</c> <c>rect</c>, <c>a:stretch</c>, unrotated,
/// and nine of the ten also state <c>a:srcRect</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Reach: <b>10 of 240 corpus <c>xlsx</c>, 10 shapes</b>, every one a
/// <c>Volunteer_Sign_Up_Sheet_Template_*</c> and every one previously drawing nothing in that
/// rectangle. Rendering the whole <c>xlsx</c> track twice under <c>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</c> moves
/// exactly those ten and leaves the other 230 byte-identical, and <b>no page count and no
/// alphanumeric count moves on any of them</b> — which is why no gate column could ever see this.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>features/sheet-shape-picture-fill.xlsx</c> is built by
