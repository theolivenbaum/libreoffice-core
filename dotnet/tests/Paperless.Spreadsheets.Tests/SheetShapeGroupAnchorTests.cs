/// Where a BIFF shape's text lands: inside the group that holds the shape, and inside the
/// margin the shape asks the host for.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A shape inside a group states no client anchor.</strong> It carries an
/// <c>msofbtChildAnchor</c> — a rectangle in the group's own coordinate space — and only the
/// group's own shape says where that space lands on the sheet. A reader that asks every shape
/// for a client anchor therefore draws none of a group's members, which is what this tree did:
/// <c>ZGROUPA</c> and <c>ZGROUPB</c> are absent from the base rendering altogether.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>A shape's text margin is two different rules.</strong> One that sets
/// <c>fAutoTextMargin</c> states no lengths and the host answers with a constant — Excel's is
/// 20000 EMU, 1.5748 pt, on all four sides. One that does not sets <c>dxTextLeft</c> and its
/// three siblings itself, and LibreOffice's own <c>MS Excel 97</c> filter writes all four as
/// zero.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>sheet-shape-group-anchor.xls</c> is <c>sheet-shape-group-anchor.fods</c> put through
/// LibreOffice 26.2.4.2's own <c>MS Excel 97</c> filter, so its Escher group, its child anchors
/// and its stated margins are the reference's own writing.
/// <c>sheet-shape-group-margin.xls</c> is that same file with two bits changed: property 191 is
/// the text boolean group and the filter never sets <c>fAutoTextMargin</c> in it, so the flag has
/// to be turned on by hand for any fixture to carry it. Nothing else differs and no length
/// anywhere changes — see <c>probes/sheet-shape-r103/patch-automargin.py</c>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Every expected number is the baseline origin 26.2.4.2 writes into its own PDF of the same
/// file. The sheet's columns are 1 cm and 6 cm alternating and its rows 0.5 cm and 3 cm, so a
/// child mapped by interpolating column <em>indices</em> rather than lengths lands nowhere near
/// these.
/// </para>
