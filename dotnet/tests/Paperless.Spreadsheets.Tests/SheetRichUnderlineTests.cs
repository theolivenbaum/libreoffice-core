/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The decoration used to be taken from the <em>cell's</em> format and drawn across the whole
/// line, on the stated grounds that "the run geometry to place a partial rule with does not exist
/// yet". It did — <c>SheetTextSegment</c> has carried <c>Offset</c> and <c>Width</c> all along —
/// and the consequence of not using them was that a cell underlining only its first run drew no
/// rule at all whenever the cell's own font was not underlined. That is the commonest shape this
/// takes: a heading ruled off inside a cell that also holds unruled text after it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Pinned here because the change that fixed it landed without a test and was reported as not
/// having worked. It had: measured on <c>Infotabelle_WLAN im Flugzeug.xlsx</c> page 2 at 150 dpi,
/// the rule is a single row of black at y = 802 px running x = 105 to 350 px, which is baseline
/// + 0.36 pt and exactly the first portion's own span — it stops where the colon after
/// <c>Innereuropäische Flüge</c> begins. The reference draws its own rule at baseline + 1 px over
/// a narrower span, because it substitutes a narrower face for the absent <c>Segoe UI</c>.
