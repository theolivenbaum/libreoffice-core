/// <c>ThemeBuffer::ThemeBuffer</c> (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/themebuffer.cxx:31-33</c>), where it
/// carries a "TODO: locale dependent font name" that has never been done. Nothing in the theme
/// part overrides it: <c>getDefaultFontModel</c> hands back that same object however the
/// workbook's major and minor fonts are declared.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The fixture is <c>dotnet/probes/sheets-rest-01/mkfontprobe.py</c>, whose <c>fonts[0]</c> is
/// deliberately <em>Arial 10</em> so that the two candidate answers are distinguishable — a
/// fixture whose default font were Calibri 11 would pass either way. Measured against the
/// installed LibreOffice 26.2.4.2, reading the face out of its own PDF: <c>&lt;font/&gt;</c>
/// draws in Caladea-Regular at 11.00 pt, <c>&lt;font&gt;&lt;b/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</c> in
/// Caladea-Bold at 11.00, <c>&lt;font&gt;&lt;sz val="20"/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</c> in Caladea-Regular
/// at 20.01, and <c>&lt;font&gt;&lt;name val="Arial"/&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</c> in LiberationSans at
/// <em>11.00</em>. Caladea is Cambria's metric-compatible substitute, which is what makes the
/// answer visible in a rendering at all.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>ans_mappings_of_eccairs_terms.xlsx</c> is the corpus case: five of its seventeen fonts name
/// no face, the reference embeds Caladea-Regular and Caladea-Bold for them, and setting those runs
/// in a sans face left a few extra characters on most of its pages and one extra page over 190.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The size half matters on its own and is the wider reach: the rule was previously 10 pt, so
/// every <c>&lt;font&gt;</c> naming a face and stating no <c>sz</c> was a point small.
