/// <c>sheet-shape-ink.xlsx</c>, so both readers are answering for the same five shapes and every
/// divergence between them is ours. The ODF file states each shape's ink on its
/// <c>draw:style-name</c> graphic style — <c>draw:fill</c>, <c>draw:fill-color</c>,
/// <c>draw:stroke</c>, <c>svg:stroke-color</c>, <c>svg:stroke-width</c> — and its geometry as a
/// <c>draw:enhanced-geometry</c> whose <c>draw:type</c> keeps the DrawingML preset's name under
/// an <c>ooxml-</c> prefix.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>The page count is the half no colour census could have found.</strong> 26.2.4.2 prints
/// this file on <b>two</b> pages, the second of them empty, because the rightmost object on the
/// sheet is the bare box — a rectangle stating <c>draw:fill="none"</c> and
/// <c>draw:stroke="none"</c> — and <c>ScDrawLayer::GetPrintArea</c> widens the printed block to
/// cover every object on the draw page, its only exclusion being the hidden-comment layer
/// (<c>sc/source/core/data/drwlayer.cxx</c>:1397-1414). The reader answered null for a shape with
/// neither text nor a picture, so that object was not in the model at all and this file printed on
/// one page. The <c>.xlsx</c> twin was already two of two, because an <c>xdr:sp</c> has always
/// produced a drawing whatever it holds.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Against 26.2.4.2's own marks this tree draws all five to <b>0.07 pt</b>, and closer in x than
/// the <c>.xlsx</c> path manages — 242.62 against 242.59 — because ODF states the rectangle
/// outright where SpreadsheetML states cells and offsets.
