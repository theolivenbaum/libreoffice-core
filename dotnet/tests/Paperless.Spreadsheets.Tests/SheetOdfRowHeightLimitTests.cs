/// A row height in a spreadsheet file is usually the writing application's own measurement rather
/// than a statement, and Calc throws it away and measures again on load — except here.
/// <c>ScXMLTableRowContext::endFastElement</c> adds each row block to the recalculation ranges and
/// then takes it straight back out when the block ends past row 200 and its style carries a
/// stored height alongside the optimal flag (<c>sc/source/filter/xml/xmlrowi.cxx</c>:215-244,
/// under the comment <em>"recalc only the first 200 row in case of optimal document loading"</em>).
/// The row indices there are zero-based, so the boundary the test below reads off 26.2.4.2 — rows
/// 0 to 200 recalculated, 201 onwards not — is <c>nCurrentRow &gt; 200</c> exactly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It is an <em>importer's</em> rule and not a layout one: the BIFF and SpreadsheetML filters
/// recalculate every automatic row and have no such limit, which is why it sits in
/// <c>OdsPrintSetup</c> and reaches <see cref="SheetOptimalRowHeights"/> only as a row's optimal
/// flag being false.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Reach on the converted-ODF corpus is wide and the cost is pages:
/// <c>Laser Report 2024 FOIA __Oct (1).ods</c> states <c>style:row-height="0.2189in"</c> with the
/// optimal flag on every one of its rows, and printed 486 pages against the reference's 506
/// because all of them were recomputed to a shorter 15.0 pt.
/// <c>dotnet/probes/ods-resid-r80/results.md</c> has the measurement.
