/// <strong>The rule is asymmetric, and both halves are pinned here because the symmetric reading
/// is the natural mistake.</strong> A run anchored to the <em>left</em> of a page's column band
/// is not painted on it at all, however far its output area reaches; a run anchored to the
/// <em>right</em> of the band is. Calc's string output looks one column past <c>mnX2</c>
/// unconditionally (<c>output2.cxx:1660-1678</c>) but one column before <c>mnX1</c> only
/// <c>if (mnX1 &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; !bTaggedPDF)</c> (<c>:1541-1543</c>) — and <c>UseTaggedPDF</c>
/// defaults to <c>true</c>, so the reference never takes that branch.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured against 26.2.4.2 rather than read off the source, because the C++ tree beside this
/// one is a later development version. Rendering <c>essd-16-3433-2024-t02.xlsx</c> through the
/// same binary twice, changing nothing but that one filter option, gives words per page
/// <c>439 / 0 / 0 / 0</c> tagged and <c>439 / 315 / 152 / 49</c> untagged. Painting the lead-in
/// anyway cost 617 surplus words on <c>RCO_VOR_Master_List_082824.xlsx</c>, spread over five
/// pages the reference leaves blank, and 514 on <c>essd</c> itself.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The second half of the rule is <c>bOutside</c> (<c>:2037</c>): of the cell found past the

/// does not overlap the block at all is skipped. Each fixture's rows differ in nothing but the
/// length or the neighbours of one string, so a renderer cannot satisfy them by choosing a side.

/// <para>
/// A merged block anchored in a hidden column is a third case and is here for a related reason:
