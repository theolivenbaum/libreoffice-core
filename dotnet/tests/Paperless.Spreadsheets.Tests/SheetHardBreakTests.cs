/// Calc keeps such a cell as an <c>EditTextObject</c> rather than as a string, and
/// <c>ScOutputData::LayoutStringsImpl</c> sends every <c>CELLTYPE_EDIT</c> cell to
/// <c>DrawEdit</c> without asking anything else about it (<c>output2.cxx:1711-1712</c>), where
/// one paragraph is one line. So the width the column has left decides where a paragraph is
/// broken and never whether it is.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The defect this pins is the opposite reading. <see cref="SheetTextLayout"/> shaped the cell's
/// whole text and returned it as a single line whenever that fitted the column, so
/// <c>Alpha\nBravo\nCharlie</c> in a six-centimetre column — which fits three times over — was
/// drawn concatenated on one line, while <c>LineCount</c> beside it split on the break first and
/// reserved three lines' height for it. Measured on <c>CSA_CCM_v1.2.xls</c>, 13 pages against 13
/// and 17079 extractable words against 15852, of which 1123 were this.

/// <strong>Row 2 is the case the two families answer differently, and this fixture is ODF, so it

/// single-line mode for a cell whose format does not wrap
