/// <c>ScOutputData::LayoutStrings</c> asks the question before it looks at a single character:
/// <c>else if (aCell.getType() == CELLTYPE_EDIT) bUseEditEngine = true</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/ui/view/output2.cxx:1710-1712</c>). Both importers build such a cell from a
/// string that carries formatting runs — <c>putRichString</c>
/// (<c>sc/source/filter/oox/sheetdatabuffer.cxx:125-133</c>) and
/// <c>XclImpString::SetToDocument</c> (<c>sc/source/filter/excel/xihelper.cxx:246-256</c>) — and,
/// on the OOXML side, from one holding a hard break.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Two consequences, and the fixtures separate them because the triggers are not the same.
/// <em>Clipping</em>: <c>DrawStrings</c> shortens a string that will not fit before showing it and
/// <c>DrawEdit</c> keeps every character behind a clip, so only the second leaves the hidden tail
/// in the PDF's text layer — which is the half a word count scores. <em>Height</em>: an edit cell
/// is measured through <c>GetNeededSize</c>'s EditEngine branch even when it does not wrap, and one
/// EditEngine line is not the arithmetic height <c>lcl_GetAttribHeight</c> gives.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Both fixtures come from <c>dotnet/probes/sheets-rest-01/mkclipprobe.py</c>, five rows differing
/// in one property each — plain, rich, hard-broken, both, and plain-but-wrapping — in a column too
/// narrow for their text with the neighbour occupied so that nothing may spill. Measured against
/// the installed LibreOffice 26.2.4.2: the plain row's text layer holds <strong>23</strong> of its
/// 130 characters and the rich, broken and rich-plus-broken rows hold all <strong>130</strong>;
/// with automatic heights the plain row takes <strong>276 twips</strong> — the arithmetic answer
/// for Calibri 11 exactly — and the other three take <strong>298</strong>.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <strong>Two properties of the fixture are load-bearing and were both got wrong first.</strong>
/// It is Calibri 11 and not Arial 9, because Arial 9's line is shorter than
/// <c>ScGlobal::nStdRowHeight</c> and every row came back at the 256-twip floor with plain and
/// rich indistinguishable. And every <c>cellXf</c> states <c>applyFont="1"</c> beside a
/// <c>cellStyles</c>, because without them LibreOffice drew the plain rows in its own application
/// default while the rich rows took the face their <c>rPr</c> named — and that version of the
/// fixture said a hard break did *not* reach the EditEngine height, which is the opposite of the
/// truth.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <c>CIS_Debian_Linux_8_Benchmark_v1.0.0.xls</c> is the clipping half in the corpus: its
/// remediation and audit columns hold paragraphs with blank lines between their parts, and the
/// 1440 words it was short were exactly their hidden tails. <c>SIL_TDB648.xlsx</c> is the height
/// half: 285 twips a row for its plain rows against 298 for its rich footnote rows, which is
/// enough to fit two extra rows on a page.
