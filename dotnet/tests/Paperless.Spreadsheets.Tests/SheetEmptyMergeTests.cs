/// A merged block that holds nothing still stops a neighbour's long string.

/// <para>
/// <c>ScOutputData::IsAvailable</c> stops at "non-empty <em>or merged or overlapped</em>"
/// (<c>sc/source/ui/view/output2.cxx:1178-1191</c>), so what a merged block contains is beside the
/// point: a title beside one is clipped at the end of its own column whether the block is a
/// sub-heading or blank.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The reason this needs a test of its own is where the merge comes from. Every format states its
/// merges once, as a list of ranges, and every reader then puts the span on the block's top-left
/// cell and drops the cells it covers — which recovers the merge only when that top-left cell
/// survives. An empty cell past the last filled one in its row is trailing padding that every one
/// of the four readers drops, so a merge whose whole block is blank was reaching layout as no
/// merge at all. <see cref="SheetLayout.StatedMerges"/> carries the ranges themselves for exactly
/// this case.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Measured on <c>Bulletin-37-Appendix-2-immediate-detriment-data-request.xlsx</c>, whose A1 title
/// ran straight through its empty <c>B1:D1</c> merge and onto the next column band: 554 words
/// against LibreOffice's 541, and 541 now. Checked against LibreOffice 24.2.7.2's own PDF for the
/// fixture — its first page carries "Blocked title that would otherw" and neither page carries
/// "BLOCKEDTAIL" — and re-checked against 26.2.4.2, which agrees word for word on both pages.
